""""SERVICE REMINDERS""""
About a week ago, a message alert popped up on my screen which stated the next ""A Service"" was due in 170 days. There are 2 types of service - an A and a B. Then, today, another message popped up stating the next ""A Service"" was due in 4500 miles.
My question is why does it alert me in ""days"" to the next service and ""miles"" to the next service? Sometimes days, sometimes miles. Why not one or the other?

""SALES EXPERIENCE""

My downstairs neighbor went to the Toyota Dealership yesterday and called me this morning to ask if I could get him a good deal on a new Camry. I agreed to accompany him back at noon this afternoon.

We met the salesman who worked with him yesterday at 12:15 PM this afternoon. The car he was looking at was a 2014 Camry LE 4 cyl base car with cloth interior. MSRP was $24,523 and the Edmunds Tru-Value price $21,523.

He wanted a better deal than the Tru-Value price. The dealer had offered to sell the car for $22,125 + dealer fees of $599. I showed him my old business card and told him we would buy the car right now for $20,000 including dealer fees + tax, tags and title fees.

After about 20 minutes, as expected, he returned with the manager. He introduced himself and asked if I knew what the invoice price of the car was. I responded $22,418, but Edmunds Tru-value price was $21,523. I told him I knew the 2015's were due out with a complete re-styling in a few weeks and that we were buying a car that would be worth thousands less because of the new model.

He asked if we would consider a red sedan, and I then said, in front of the manager, that we were on our way to an AutoNation dealership where I knew I could get my price. He relented and gave us the deal I proposed - $20,000 including fees +tax +tags + title. He drove his car home with me following in my car. Luckily he had no trade as he was selling his old car to one of the guys in the building next to ours.

I am sure he still made a few bucks because there are some great incentives available to the dealer to reduce their 2014 inventories.

The Edmunds Tru-Market Value pricing is a good start, but there are better deals out there if you know how to negotiate.

Now, one of my Dad's old golfing buddies wants me to help him buy a new Sonata. I figure what the heck - I have nothing else to do with my time and Dad appreciated my consenting to help one of his old cronies.",I mentioned that I was happy to be receiving an email alert when people post on this forum.

I am not in disagreement with your position, isell! Bloomingdales, Macy's, Boeing, Walmart, etc., do not share that information so why should auto dealers?

It is up to the buyer to research pricing in any way he can. Edmunds is just one source. What's fair in love and war? Everything and anything goes, in my opinion.

It is the buyer's responsibility to learn as much as he can about vehicle pricing. But it is not the responsibility of the dealership to share net/net/net cost of a car.

There are thousands of variations to the story but this sums it up:
There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things mechanical. After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired. Several years later his company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past. The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day he marked a small ""x"" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated, ""This is where your problem is."" The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $10,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly: One chalk mark......................$1 Knowing where to put it........$9,999 It was paid in full and the engineer retired in peace",http://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/comment/1941267/#Comment_1941267

RICHARD - WELCOME ME TO YOUR CLUB!!!

sterlingdog:

On Saturday, my internet access went down. I originally thought it was an area problem but, alas, it was probably my line or my modem/router. I called Comcast and Sunday morning, their technician arrived. He said it was my modem that crashed.

He replaced my modem (which has a router included for WiFi), and I again had internet access at noon yesterday. But that was just the beginning of my trials and tribulations. You see, because the modem/router is in the back bedroom (Dad's room), the WiFi signal is very weak by the time it gets to the front bedroom. 2 years ago I bought a ""repeater"" and set it up in the living room. It picks up the signal from the back bedroom, amplifies it, and sends out the signal to the front bedroom, where I use my iPhone for accessing the internet.

Unfortunately, when he changed the modem/router, the repeater was not able to convert the signal since it is on a different frequency. So I read the directions first. After reading them 4 times and fiddling with passwords and codes and wires, etc., I went to my Dad and asked him for his .38 caliber pistol so I could put myself out of my misery.

Next, after choosing life over death this time, I called Amped Wireless to get some technical assistance. After waiting for 55 minutes on the phone for a technician, I was overjoyed when a young man answered in a strange and husky accent - probably from the southern Asian peninsula adjacent to the Indian Ocean. I could not understand one out of every two words he spoke. After 1 hour on the phone and getting absolutely nowhere, I hung up. I had wires, disks, power lines and papers filled with my notes all around me in a 6 foot circumference around the computer desk.

I had second thoughts about my decision to live rather than commit suicide when, as if ""Manna"" from heaven, I saw a business card drop to the floor from all my cache of notes and directions. It was this geek who put my computer together three years ago - there is a God, no doubt about it.

I called him, left a message, and he called me back and said he would be over at 4:00 PM today to fix the programming of the new router. He got here at 4:10 PM, asked for a cold drink, sat down at the computer, and 4 minutes later, he asked me for a password for the router. One minute later, and $40.00 poorer, he left and my repeater was working perfectly.

EMBARRASSING SITUATION

On most Tuesdays, not all, but most, I take Dad out to dinner at NYY Steak at the casino. He usually has steak and I get the lobster tails.

After dinner, I ordered Dad his chocolate layer cake which he nibbles at and then he likes to take the rest home with him.

While he's nibbling on his dessert, the new General Manager of the restaurant stopped by our table to introduce himself. We started talking and about 3-4 minutes into our conversation, my father abruptly asked when someone was going to put his layer cake into a doggie bag so he could take it home. I told him this is not a waiter and that he is not the person to ask to put his leftover dessert into a doggie bag. Dad says, ""...why shouldn't 'he work for his high salary!""

I could have died right then and there. I apologized to Noel (new manager), but he insisted on packing up the dessert and put it into a shopping bag. He handed the bag to Dad and excused himself. I let my Dad have it - like, ""...where do you come off interrupting our conversation and asking the General Manager to pack up your leftover dessert?""

He responded that he didn't do or say that! Good grief! He didn't even remember what he had done. 4 minutes ago. It was so embarrassing. His dementia is getting so bad he does not remember conversations we had 20 minutes ago.

Unless you live with this day in and day out, no one would believe this is happening. Even my brother doesn't believe me. He thinks his once every two week phone call to him is an example of what he is like.

I took it for a drive and it was OK, nothing special - these were essentially K-cars with a bit more sound insulation and nicer trim, so it was a rather underwhelming drive, but nice enough given the pricing. I stopped in a shopping center parking lot under one of their light standards to look it over on the outside (it was dark by the time I drove it). Without a whole lot of effort I was able to see that the passenger side had been repainted - there was a tiny but of overspray in a few spots and it was missing the pinstripe that the other side had.

I know you asked for Isell's opinion on this, but for what it's worth, I have a few comments about Acura and Honda as someone who was in the car business for over 10 years.

From my experiences, the two brands are very differently perceived by buyers. Honda buyers tend to be in the market for a reasonably priced economical car that will last 5+ years with little or no major mechanical problems.

Acura buyers tend to be in the market for a mid-sized luxury car that is sporty, practical and reliable. They are willing to pay several thousand dollars more for those features Honda buyers tend to reject.

I've known many salesmen who worked at both Honda and Acura dealerships. They always felt that their products were above reproach, but would have no difficulty referring their customers to Honda (if Acura salesmen) or Acura (if Honda Salesmen).

They all seemed to feel that Acura customers were more upscale and Honda customers more middle of the road. Acura customers, in general, would not consider a Honda purchase. Honda customers, in general, would consider an Acura purchase.

The salesmen I knew who sold both lines had no negative feelings toward one or the other brand. Each brand serves a slightly different clientele.",Hands out for a slapping for crossing the political line.....

Larry C","Does anybody have an opinion why VW's sales are plunging? Seems Audi is doing fine, but VW is in the toilet. My thesis is that Toyota clone without Toyota's reliability finally caught up with them. They have always been below average with reliability, but driving experience, edgy styling and features were offsetting it. They had a niche, but the fans were quite fanatic. Then they decided on cutting price with features (e.g. suspension, brakes on base versions are different than on upper trims) to raise sales. The styling also went generic. Worked initially, but now it seems you simply cannot outcamry Toyota. Others tried it before and failed as well. Seems VW had to find it out on their own."

I too am skeptical of turbos. They run at very high speeds and require the best in lubrication and maintenance which may not always happen with a rental/lease vehicle.

The only reason I can think of is that the dealer put so much money in the trade that to fix it up would not be financially sound. So he put it on the lot hoping to get what he put into the trade.

I am also guessing that he put more into the trade than he could get wholesale for it at the auction. So he put a high price on it and the first offer he gets that is near what he put into it, he will accept.

Just received a past due parking notice from a company called LAZ Parking for a violation that occurred at the Metro North parking facility in Poughkeepsie about 100 miles away.
Only problem is I haven't been to Poughkeepsie in years, I've never ridden a Metro North train, they give no date for the infraction and the plate # they cite doesn't belong to any car I own now or have recently owned.
I called their service number and the clerk said it was a ""discrepancy"" because the plate # was a Wisconsin plate. I asked them how it came back to me since I never had that plate # and she just repeated that it was a discrepancy and I could ignore it. We'll see if that is that.
It just got me wondering because a few years ago my son got a parking ticket notice from the city of Poughkeepsie which turned out to be an error. Do you folks who live in the big cities ever experience this?

I was surfing the net and came across this interesting nugget on the 2016 Tucson.
""Hyundai just released it’s first ever Gasoline Direct Injection-Hydrogen engine in the US with the debut of the 2016 Hyundai Tucson. This particular power train is projected to achieve 48 mph in the city and 72 mph on the highway. It also features an industry first, 17 airbags and a voice activated power lift gate.The Hyundai Tucson, known for its combination of style and function, adds even more value in 2016 with advanced 3.7-liter, 7-cylinder, 9-speed automatic transmission.
It’s brand new Gasoline Direct Injection-Hydrogen (GDI-H) engines, enhancing torque and engine responsiveness. With the GDI-H becoming standard on Tucson beginning in 2016, every Hyundai CUV will now features this performance-enhancing technology. Tucson is the first Hyundai to receive the 3.7-liter GDI-H engine in the United States. It will be applied to other models later in the 2016 model year.

In addressing these problems GM has taken a comprehensive approach to safety by recalling vehicles for every minor issue, regardless of cost, that now runs into the billions of dollars.

If you constantly operated the engine at full throttle you might well effect the longevity of the engine, although in my experience even the occasional track weekend doesn't hurt anything, The Mazda boards do contain stories of blown engines, but in virtually every case the engines have been significantly modified and or have received a ""home brewed"" ECU tune. I wouldn't lose any sleep over owning a 4 cyl. turbo- but then I've owned three: a 1984 Thunderbird Turbo Coupe, a 1991 Volvo 740 Turbo, and my 2007 MS3."

""It is a poor craftsman who blames his tools.""","As for the 2014 I drove, I can sum it up in two words: Big Cruiser. And I don't mean that as a slam. The thing is huge- 198"" long and 4,000 pounds. Still, the 305 bhp Pentastar does a decent job of moving the big sled down the road; while a 0-60 in the mid sixes and a 15 second quarter mile cannot be considered even remotely fast, it is adequate for this car's intended purpose. And it is relatively efficient, averaging 29 mpg at an 80 mph cruise. The 5 speed automatic works OK, but it isn't all that responsive in manual shift mode. And I think that the sideways autostick function is beyond moronic; left to downshift, right to upshift? Which imbecile gave the green light to that?"

While I would prefer much tighter shock damping and roll stiffness, the person who buys this car is never going to come close to pushing it to its modest limits. Steering effort was high(which most drivers think-wrongly-equates to steering feel) but not very communicative. Still, it was fine for the type of driving this car encourages. Ditto for the brakes.

I think y'all know I love my Volvos.
On the bed issue, we bought a Tempurpedic I think around 7-8 yrs ago.

So pretty near the cost of a high-end spring mattress. I have no doubt this will last a very long time. While I wouldn't consider it the most comfortable bed in the world, it has helped my back issues immensely.
Not too long ago, I got one of those Amazon ones for my son. I think it was $200 or so for the thicker model (Twin). I really like that one. It is softer than our Tempurpedic.

They said they are going to do another scan in 5 weeks and determine if it has changed in any way. At that time they will determine what to do. They did not call it benign at this time due to the location and the affect it has had on him.

They said they are going to do another scan in 5 weeks and determine if it has changed in any way. At that time they will determine what to do. They did not call it benign at this time due to the location and the affect it has had on him.

Question for the good folks here ....
If you have an older (non-classic) car, do you have full insurance on it? Comprehensive and collision?
I ask because two of my co-workers at the pizza place totaled their cars in the past 6 weeks - one on a delivery and the other in a non-delivery situation. Car 1 was an '03 Hyundai Sonata; car 2 was an early '00's Nissan Xterra. Neither had collision insurance. The owner of the Sonata had another car (late model Honda Pilot) that he is now using for delivery. The owner of the Xterra had to quit because she didn't have another car to drive.
It seems silly to me to drop collision insurance when you use your car for work.

The center column would then be removed completely and replaced by three angular steel beams which would support the original brick once it was placed back in position.

Everything is a trade-off; to me the issues that I deal with that tend to be endemic to BMWs(or Mazdaspeed 3s, TJs,or T300s) are more than outweighed by the pleasure that they give me when I drive/ride them."

However, whether it is luxury (Lincoln ,Cadillac) or mainstream (Chevrolet, Chrysler), I still find majority of American branded vehicles bulky and aesthetically unappealing from the outside - I know some like those waterfall chrome grills or ""take no prisoners attitude"" from Cadillac, for me it's a repellant, amplified by their horrible advertising. After that ad that I mentioned already (one with ""luxury through centuries, slaves sold separately"" theme), I'd be simply embarrassed to buy a car.

We considered dropping the Eyesight option, but several discussions in the last two weeks have changed our minds. The final discussion that swung me towards Eyesight was actually a candidate I was interviewing for a position reporting to me at work, and he was recovering from a significant accident that would have been prevented with Eyesight. At that point I made the decision that if I could afford a safety system that may save my family, myself, or others the pain and agony related to a preventable accident, then I must act on that ability and choose safety over leather or hatred for a sunroof.
So, we went down a trim level to Premium and opted out of the leather. We can add aftermarket leather later if it bothers us, but considering the van we’re replacing is fabric and we’ve been happy for 12 years, I don’t anticipate doing so.
Once we picked our trim level over the weekend, I worked up the pricing on an Excel sheet with the options, MSRP, Invoice, and my target price. I also researched contact info for 7 dealers near us. In the process of choosing the Outback, we had visited 2 different local dealers with 2015s in stock that gave us a perspective of the Premium vs Limited, and we decided to give them first shot. We visited one Saturday, but he told us they were blocked by Subaru from ordering Eyesight due to heavy demand and limited supplies. We checked that finding with others and confirmed we could indeed order, we just couldn’t expect delivery until later in the year when Subaru caught up.
Today I emailed both those two local dealers with my options and the price I thought was fair, which was 3% under invoice plus TTL. I arrived at that number by reading the online forums and choosing a slight aggressive figure knowing I had time to wait if needed. Gratefully, one came back right away with a positive confirmation that we can order and at a price that was just $50 higher than what I quoted. I was fine with that number, and tonight we’ll head over to place the order into Subaru’s system along with a deposit.
Exciting! I’m thinking delivery will probably be late October, hopefully in time for me to apply Opti-Coat 2.0 before the temperatures become too cold to properly cure it. Eyesight has been delayed and the only deliveries with the option have been demo cars for the press. Time will tell.","There is some good information about the 2015 Mustang, but, it looks like no one has driven one who can write a review yet.

Good to hear you feel like you are feeling better, fez. As far as Sloan Kettering, it's a great hospital.

I wish I could get my son in there, but his insurance is somewhat restrictive. He is supposed to be officially transferred from Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage to the Loma Linda medical complex in the Inland Empire (Riverside County). They are supposed to be the best for his medical condition. Laser is also an option for him.

I remember you saying that a while back- hence the ""certified nutjob"" comment.","Check this out. I hadn't had a haircut in three months so in I go today. The shop, a mom and daughter place. Mom is 65, daughter is 37. Both very nice and honest to a fault. Mom had a 2010 Dodge Challenger 5.7 Hemi A/T she bought new. Started having trans trouble in June, took it in for diagnosis. They told her it was a computer box behind the dash and would take 2 days and $800 to fix. She had bought many cars from them over the years so went to the new car side and took a look at a 2014 Dodge Ram 1500 4WD. She was a little upset with the deal (trading a non perfect running car), but accepted it and bought the red truck. It had adjustable pedals which she had set for herself after the test drive. They took the truck in for detail and put it out front for delivery. All ready to go home she starts it up. The truck takes off full speed squealing tires across the lot, over a concrete tire stop, through the bushes, down the hill between two light poles barely missing a line of new cars, over two more concrete tire stops coming to a sideways stop in muddy grass only feet from the 6 lane highway in front of Shelor Dodge. They didn't know what happened. She blamed the detailer for resetting the pedals. I didn't hear Shelors side of it, but I believe her telling of it with the exception that since she said the brakes didn't work, I believe she got her foot under the brake and firmly on the gas. (just my opinion). They said we'll have the truck fixed up for you in a couple of days, here, take this rental car. She wanted nothing to do with that truck and two days later (after a hospital visit-she was banged up pretty good) she picked out a white one slightly better trim which they gave her for the same deal. I asked if the new one had adjusable pedals to which she replied yes, but she has never touched the button."

Trade-ins are funny business. You just never know where they’re going to fall. The best bet is to get as much information as you possibly can, have qbrozen look up the recent auction numbers for you, and (if you can spare the time) go to CarMax and get a solid offer from them.
Recently I was thinking of trading in my 2013 F150, and getting a new 2014. Go with the Eco Boost engine, get a few more options (back up camera, for one thing). I found one I liked, got the price down to a fairly reasonable point, and asked them to evaluate my trade. They came back at $21k. I laughed , and tried to walk. The sales manager came over and upped the offer to $24k. I still walked, went straight to CarMax, who made a solid offer to buy at $25,500.
The $24k wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t very good either. My Ford should be worth at least as much to a Ford dealer as it is to CarMax. But the starting offer was terrible, and I still feel like they were trying to ___ me.

""Yep, but I figured you guys were the gurus who were always at the dealers and someone might know someone or helped someone shop.""

Gurus? Is that the same as ""mavens""? ""In the knows""? ""Pro Car Buyers""? ""Can't Fool Us""? I guess we represent a wealth of knowledge and experience and, therefore are capable of giving advice to would-be-car-buyers that is helpful and hopefully appreciated.

My take is that most people think they know all the tricks in the car-buying-game. After all, that's what it really is - A GAME! Unfortunately, dealerships and salespeople are better at playing the game than most, but not all, car buyers.

There is one superior advantage that the customer has over the dealership - the customer has control anytime he wants to ""take control"" - and that's by walking out the door!!! If more customers knew how to better use that superior advantage, they have won the game. Try walking out of a dealership when negotiations are at an impasse. Who has the upper hand when the customer starts walking for the door? How long does it take for the sales manager to get to the buyer before he reaches the door? 10 seconds? 20 seconds? Not more than that elapsed time.

If there was one thing I would teach the would-be-buyer, it would be what I just described above. Be relaxed, know pretty much what you want to pay for your new car; know what your car is actually worth wholesale; then learn that the customer has the upper hand in this game - the ability/power to take control by walking out the door.

P.S. It sure is good to be back home!!!",If it needs a new engine it is only worth scrap value. The kid could get the same $2000 off sticker on a year end deal. Having replaced several engines myself I'm pretty sure it will cost $2000 just for the replacement motor.

The discussion on colors is interesting, as I was out cruising the dealership lots this morning (they are all closed here on Sundays) looking at what might tickle my fancy if I decide to change cars once the lease on the Regal is up in a couple of months. I was struck by how dark and dreary so many of the colors on the cars inventory were.
I don't know if this is typical everywhere or a local thing, but the dealers here seem loath to order a car for stock with anything other than a black interior. That is bad for me as I hate black interiors. I saw a Lacrosse at one of the Buick dealers in ""Champagne Silver"", which isn't silver at all but a pale gold or tan metallic, and figured that would have some color inside. Nope, black. All the Lacrosses I saw were black leather. I don't think I want one of those anyway, but black leather kills it for me.

I can't find that brown on the website so I don't know what's up with that.
I was surprised to see they have 2 leftover 2013s parked out front, one of them a 550, with writing on the windshields about how much they are discounted.

They had a C-series coupe parked next to an E-350 coupe out front also. I like the look of the E coupe much better than the C but was surprised that it didn't look all that much bigger than the C. Inside it seemed much smaller than the E sedans so I would have to see if I fit OK.

The discussion on colors is interesting, as I was out cruising the dealership lots this morning (they are all closed here on Sundays) looking at what might tickle my fancy if I decide to change cars once the lease on the Regal is up in a couple of months. I was struck by how dark and dreary so many of the colors on the cars inventory were.
I don't know if this is typical everywhere or a local thing, but the dealers here seem loath to order a car for stock with anything other than a black interior. That is bad for me as I hate black interiors. I saw a Lacrosse at one of the Buick dealers in ""Champagne Silver"", which isn't silver at all but a pale gold or tan metallic, and figured that would have some color inside. Nope, black. All the Lacrosses I saw were black leather. I don't think I want one of those anyway, but black leather kills it for me. The other ones in inventory were a black metallic paint outside which I don't like either, and ""Graphite Blue"" which I thought was black until I got close - it is very, very dark and I didn't like it.
Over on the Cadillac side, all models in inventory were also black leather. At first I thought they were all painted black. A few were - some solid black, some that same metallic black as the Buick - but others just looked black. One was painted ""Majestic Plum"" which is a color I had seen listed on Caddy's web page but had never recognized in the flesh. Well, it turns out it is so dark that it reads as black unless it's in direct sunlight. Really a shame, it is kind of lifeless. They had one in Phantom Gray, which is a dark gray but not a shade I like (some grays look good to me but not this one). The ATS models were parked alongside the CTS models and they really look small by comparison. I like the CTS better but it is much more expensive too.
I rolled through the BMW lot fairly quickly as I'm not that interested in them but I was struck by how all the cars in inventory seemed to be painted either black or white. There may have been a silver one but I'm not sure of that. Aside from one of the 2-seaters (Z4?) which was red, no color at all there. Odd.

But it was the second generation that really marked the turning point: the 1980′s were GM’s worst decade ever in terms of market share loss; and the Seville (along with that other DS, the Citation) kicked off that decade from hell in grand style: a near-perfect synthesis of wretched design and ruinous engineering.

It’s kind of obvious if you actually talk to the person, they generally know absolutely nothing about the actual business, their job is to just listen calmly until you vent all of your anger / frustration.","The only warning I would have is if you leave your car outside and your area is prone to vandalism.

BWIA,

Regarding your vehicle storage, here's how I store my watercraft during winter:
1. Add fuel stabilizer and run the motor so the stabilizer mixes through the entire fuel system. That's typically my last ride for the year.
2. Fog the motor with Sta-bil fogging oil. I spray some in the air intake with the filter removed while idling and just before shutting down the motor for the last time.
3. Remove each spark plug and spray fogging oil into the chamber, then add a little anti-seize to the threads and re-torque each plug to factory specs.
4. Spray some anti-corrosion film onto the metal motor components.
5. Fill the trailer tires to near max inflation to prevent flat spots.
6. Remove the battery and place it on a battery tender.
7. Open up all the compartments to dry them out and prevent humidity building up anywhere.
8. Store it in the garage.
9. Lubricate the linkages.
10. Seal the fiberglass and plastic. This year I'll be adding the paint coating instead.

Perhaps there are a few things that could carry over to storing a car in a humid environment for half a year. Good luck!","So many of these new grills remind me of the movie ""Jaws"". Ugly doesn't begin to describe them."

""People will buy the nearest, easy to buy vehicle in whatever colors the dealer ordered. It's called taking the path of least resistance.""

From my experiences in the automobile sales angle, you are pretty much on target with your assessment of color preferences. When a customer enters the showroom, they usually approach exterior/interior color selection as the lesser of two evils - ""...we'll take anything you have in inventory so long as it isn't white or black outside and we want a light color on the inside."" They do the same thing with options - ""...we don't need an upgraded audio system or NAV, but we definitely want Michelin Tires.""

Frequently I had to put Michelin's or Goodyears on the car for them, but if the car they liked had NAV and an upgraded audio system, they took the car anyway if the price was right.

Customers were aware, for the most part, that if they selected a car from my existing inventory or one that was at the port ready to be shipped to me, they always got a better deal because I did not have to dealer trade for one they preferred. If I had to dealer trade, I usually had to give up something that was a hot seller at the time and I always had to pay for transportation both ways - costing me $300-$750, depending on how far I had to go to find that car.

I remember one deal where I had to ship a car from Houston to my dealership in Florida at a cost of $1500. At least it was not a dealer trade because we wouldn't ship a car both ways at those costs. I just paid the sending dealer triple net dealer cost.

Sometimes I would see the car I was looking for in transit to the Port of Jacksonville but headed for a dealer in Atlanta. So, if I was able to get the Atlanta dealer to take one of my incoming cars, it cost me nothing since the car would be redirected to me and the same would happen for the car I traded him.","There's something wrong in the methodology of that survey relative to the conclusions they are drawing from the information. 4360 randomly-selected car owners who had bought within the last 3 years. As much as some might think I'd believe Honda and BMW and Audi belong in the bottom, I agree that the spread in point scores is too small. Also, I suspect that people who are happy with their purchase of those cars, have held onto them and haven't made a purchase within the last 3 years. That skews the survey."

I find myself wondering if I am a fool for wanting a more expensive car, never having had one that was priced above $35K Cdn. I find myself daydreaming about a Mercedes E-class, maybe a coupe, maybe a sedan, and maybe even a 550. But I've never owned a car that expensive and I wonder about the issues:
I won't be able to garage it. It will have to live outside in the driveway. Not good.
I always look for the parking spot in lots that is closest to where I need to go. Will I now be that guy all by himself at the far end of the lot?
Would having an obviously expensive vehicle attract vandalism from those so inclined?
I know maintenance and any repairs out of warranty will be more expensive. Will that drive me nuts?
Will I be afraid to drive it and have fun using it? Will the prospect of a stone chip be too much to bear?

For cigarette odors, the recommended removal is with an ozone generator that breaks down the smell from the tobacco smoke that was deposited. Does that work in cars or does the ozone deteriorate materials in the cars as well?
Another is a spray called IIRC Vamoose. On contact it liberates the odorous part of the oil smoke deposits. It works in apartments and homes. However, it needs to be sprayed on things like drawers and interiors of cabinets. So in a car, those areas would still have cigarette oil deposits.

NO! From the time I submitted an order to the factory to the time I received it at the dealership, 7-8 weeks would have elapsed. All that time, I still had no sale. Additionally, there was always a trade involved and I would be taking a chance on a downward trend in value - which I would have had to eat. Usually on a SPECIAL ORDERED CAR, I would charge FULL MSRP. If I found a car for the customer at the port that was 95% of what he wanted, I would offer to sell him the car at $100,00 over my net cost just to get the sale on the books before the end of the month.

He met my price on the CRV but said that he just couldn't come up on the trade. I cut him loose. At 8:30 PM he called again. He asked if I could be there in 15 minutes.

I don't watch any of those shows nor any of the networks. ""The New Black Is Orange""? ""Mom""? ""Veep""?

2575,September 2014,nyccarguy,No Quote,"*Shows like ""Everyone Loves Raymond"", ""Frasier"", ""Seinfeld"", ""Two and a Half Men"" and the like, are situation comedies that require ""logic, cerebral analysis, deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, etc.,"" in order to appreciate the humor and the ""read between the lines"" punch lines, as well as excellent performers who deliver the humor. Additionally, shows like ""Perry Mason"", ""Ironsides"", ""Murder She Wrote"", etc., were shows that required excellent actors to perform to perfection!"

We've discussed satellite radio many times on this forum as well as the Stories Forum. Back in May, I decided to not subscribe to Sirius radio, but continue my traffic and weather services for $70.00 a year.

Over the past several days, Sirius/XM has been streaming their music stations to all receivers with the objective being getting many non-subscribers to renew their satellite radio services. They seem to do this every few months so I guess they have realized some success with this marketing approach.

A single guy who has lived there for 20 years or more, now retired from a blue-collar railway job. When I first moved here I tried to introduce myself to him early on and got blown off. I was astounded, we were perhaps 10 feet apart I am there saying ""Hello!"" 3 times and he just ignores me entirely while looking straight at me. A couple of years later he was standing in my driveway looking up. I went out to introduce myself and his first words were a threat to sue me if I didn't have a tree at the rear of the property taken out, without any prior discussion on the topic. Then one day I saw a guy in my driveway digging post holes on the property line, turned out he was employed by this clown to build a fence but hadn't told him he hadn't talked to anyone first. He then planted hedges entirely around his property and has not ever trimmed them, so they are now 12-14 feet tall and act as an impenetrable barrier."

According to his oncologist, they expect to successfully rid him of this malignant tumor. Once he completes the treatments in 3 months, they will determine if more are needed.

He has to completely shave his head prior to the treatments. His SO will drive him to and from the treatments. He has to go to Loma Linda Medical Center for the radiation - they want closer control over the therapy. It's about a 90 minute drive on I-10 from where he lives in La Quinta to Loma Linda.

Yonge St lost it's lead as longest road in the world when sections were deemed to belong to the municipalities rather than as one combined Provincial Rd. When it held the record it was about 1100 miles long.


It wasn’t until 1999 that Yonge St. was officially stripped of its title from the Guinness Book of World Records as the World’s longest road[iii]. The Pan American highway has been given this title as it starts in Argentina and travels a mere 48,000 km (30000 miles) all the way up to rural Alaska.

I'm trying to catch up. Give me time...At Costco they're $160 a pop with a $70 off if you buy four and all the freebies thrown in if you buy all four tires from them


Lots of factors to consider. Funny that 4 new tires will cost a lot less at Costco even though the guaranty would give you a free tire.

Might want to consider the tread wear on the other tires (if all need replacing Costco is worth consideration).

How much difference will high performance tires really make and is it worth the extra cost?

I learned one lesson about tires early in life. I had a 1981 Cutlass and I needed 4 tires, didn't have much extra money. I bought 4 tires at Exxon (which I think was Esso then) and they ruined the whole car. False savings!

I chopped some of your message out Mike so we'll see what actually shows up. I am trying to do my bit to save the planet.

At this stage in life I want life to be as simple as possible, so I would definitely go with all season tires if given a choice. They are good enough for almost any situation, they last longer, cost is more reasonable. Probably grip a lot better even in wet conditions.

Unless all 4 tires need replacing if one tire goes, I don't belive in rotating tires. My tires got worse and wore out faster after a rotation. I preferred letting the front ones wear out first, and just replace tires in pairs. I was on a strict buget those days, but that way I could buy 2 tires at a time. I have a friend and I found out he did the same.

SALES STORY! After four years, I am finally able to post a new car sales story. As many of you may remember, I had wanted a truck but fitting it into the garage became an impossibility. Having abandoned that prospect, I began a ruthless search for either a car or another SUV. I tried out the Honda Pilot, the MB SUV, the Explorer, the Cadillac ATS and CTS, the Subaru Legacy, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Jeep Wrangler, the Lincoln SUV, and a Chevrolet Impala. There was just something about each one that didn't excite me....either too low to the ground, poor visibility, lacking in comfort, poor materials, poor handling, etc. Two came the closest to happiness: the Cadillac CTS and the Subaru Legacy. Still, I wasn't thrilled as I have always been when purchasing a new vehicle. I finally gave up and resigned myself to waiting another year or two in hopes of better choices.

I went to my sister's home (200 miles away) to help her clean out her attic and garage and prepare to get the home ready for sale. She will now be between her Pinehurst home and her Florida home. The attic took four days---52 years of accumulation stacked from eve to eve. So many memories of a husband, wife, and two children encased in boxes, trunks, and bags. It was a sad effort at times, but we kept progressing. Needless to say, the attic was as hot as Hades. We kept drinking lots of water and moving ahead. The garage took two days but was a picnic compared to the attic. My sweet wife washed, dried, and repacked things to be saved. Sorry, but I digress.

We finished early on our last day there. After a shower and a fine, well deserved dinner, we decided to ride around and look at vehicles. My sister was also interested in a new purchase, especially a comfortable SUV. We went to several dealerships and I concentrated on helping my sister determine one or two choices for her purchase. The last dealership just before dark was the Ford. I was tired of looking at cars. After all, I had been looking at cars for days back at home. As my wife and my sister were looking around, I wandered off by myself. With many other thoughts of the day running through my head, I wasn't really paying much attention to the vehicles. Suddenly, it was as if I had been awakened. There it was---staring me right in the face, the most beautiful set of wheels I had seen in quite some time. I was nearly breathless as I moved closer. What a sight! I called to my wife and my sister who came right over. They both loved it. My wife said, ""That's you; that's it. You must call them in the morning."" The next day was Sunday and the dealershi0p was closed. We left and drove the four hours back home. All day Sunday, the images of what I had seen just wouldn't go away. I could hardly wait until Monday morning to call the dealership.

TO BE CONTINUED...in honor of Mack","There are two screens the driver can use - the main NAV screen in the upper center of the dash as well as a special settings screen in the center of the speedo housing to select special settings and safety features.  You can even change the color of the ambient lighting in the car from amber to white to pale blue, activate lane keeping and blind spot monitors, collision alert systems, acoustic locking, and 25 other special settings by just using the steering wheel buttons."

I was thinking about how you probably got a better price from buying from a dealer that is so far away. I think what he means is he is giving you a lower price than normal because 1) it is a car he sold that he never would have normally sold...kind of a bonus that was unexpected, and 2) you won't be telling too many people in his area about the price you got. If you tell someone close to home, then that will be another unexpected bonus for the dealer.

I'd get that bed protector. ""IF"" you do sell the truck one day the next guy would like to have it. Scratches and dents are easy to do too.

I read in the NY Times that Cadillac is getting ready to launch an upscale luxury sedan befitting the brand name ""Cadillac."" The luxury model will hit showrooms in late 2015 and is intended to compete head-on with the BMW 7 Series, Audi A8, and Mercedes S Class. Good luck with that.

It's a darn shame that in popular culture the name Cadillac is synonymous with luxury, yet GM cannot build a sedan with the aspirational cachet and prestige that is the global standard for luxury.

This is for ""sterlingdog"". I had a 2010 GMC extended cab and had the spray on bedliner. I didn't love it. It had the texture of sandpaper, so everything except lumber got scratched without proper padding. Also, the extra thickness made the tailgate very difficult to open as it caused binding, so it took two hands to open it. I had to push in the gate with one hand while pulling the handle. I just got a 2014 Silverado last week (see the CCBA board for details) and have ordered a DualLiner brand bed liner. After my online research, it seems that this is one of the easiest to install and is not supposed to scratch the bed.

The problem with Cadillac in many markets (like mine) is the dealer network. They cannot provide the environment to sell a very expensive car like that. In my market both Cadillac dealers sell mostly Cruzes, Sonics, and pickups, and the customer experience is what you'd expect of that. A buyer of a top-end Cadillac does not want that kind of sales and service environment. But they would not have enough volume of Cadillac alone to justify a standalone dealer.

Another problem is the image baggage that is kept around the neck of GM brands, somewhat deserved as we've discussed before, but the negative perception is often repeated by some without consideration of the changes that have occurred in GM, those changes however still hampered by the UAW double set of leg irons.

I just found a discussion of names for various autos. For GM's new rear drive Cadillac, a good name needs to be used. LTS doesn't do it for me, and that's what has been proposed. Any ideas? Fleetwood is out; Deville, Seville, STS, and others are gone.

2, 200, 2-Series, 3, 300, 370Z, 3-Series, 4Runner, 4-Series, 458, 5, 500, 500L, 500X, 5-Series, 6, 6-Series, 7-Series, 911, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, AMG GT, ATS, B-Class, BRZ, C-Class, CLA, CLS, CR-V, CR-Z, CT, CTS, CX-5, CX-9, DB9, E-Class, ELR, ES, F12, F-Series, F-Type, FF, FR-S, G37, G-Class, GLA, GLK, GS, GT-R, GX, HR-V, i3, i8, iQ, K900, LR2, LR4, LS, LX, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M-Class, MDX, MKC, MKS, MKT MKX, MKZ, MX-5, NSX, NX, Q3, Q5, Q50, Q60, Q7, Q70, QX50, QX60, QX70, QX80, R8, RAV4, RC, RDX, RLX, RS5, RS7, RX, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S60, S80, S-Class, SL, SLK, SRX, tC, TL, TLX, TSX, TT, WRX, X1, X3, X4, X5, X6, xB, XC60, XC70, XC90, xD, XE, XF, XJ, XV Crosstrek, XTS, Z4.

What name would work for Cadillac's new flagship sedan?

And those current names are just the vehicles that are currently on sale or new for 2015. It doesn't include defunct alphanumerics like STS, RSX, HHR, I30, L-Series, 1-Series, HS, etc.",@driver100 said:

I have posted before about the perpetuation of stereotypes against GM and we're alluding to that now, partly. I noticed another example in Motorweek's review of the TLX. Guess which has the most rear legroom, Malibu or TLX. Malibu at 36.8 in and TLX only has 34.5.

After all the whining about the rear seat in the Malibu for 2 years, I'd think Motorweek would have noted the deficiency in the Honda TLX. But, nope. Not a mention. I noticed the ""tester"" got into the rear seat from the other side of the car, away from the camera, and he kept his butt against the seat as he rotated in so that his legs stayed away from the front seats. I wondered if they moved the front seats forward to give the appearance of more room. This segment aired last Saturday. I'm going to look for their test of the Malibu, if any.

Their TLX review had some tepid points, but they emphasized that ""It's a Honda"" was the main thing to remember!",That's the one.  My brother has one and not only does it look magnificent but it drives like a dream!

RE: Cadillac. The Cadillac debacle in the 1980s was pretty bad. I think the name is permanently scarred, like Comcast. The brand name is somehow radioactive.

For me, it was fairly easy to pick the GM. I've had GM vehicles before and actually traded a 2010 GMC Sierra and got a nice price on the trade.

Of course NOT!

I would definitely pay for lane change warnings and a rear camera. Everything else is good to have, but I would pay up to $1000 for a package to have all of them. I think I did have to buy a tech package for the new MB that came with a bunch of other stuff like keyless start etc that did cost a few $1000.

Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow

*
Parking Sensors front and rear
*
Tire Pressure Monitoring System with Tire Fill Assist (the car ""beeps"" when you've filled up the tire to the correct pressure)

I don't know if the same is true in Canada, driver.  Down here in the U.S., there are State statutes that govern large dollar purchases mainly to protect the consumer, not the seller.
Let's assume that you sign a lease and the dealer wants you to take possession of the leased vehicle immediately.  You, on the other hand, cannot take delivery because you are leaving town in 1 hour and won't be back for delivery of the car for 1 week.
One week later, you return home to Tampa, FL. And you have a heart attack and you are rushed to the hospital.  Delivery of the vehicle is again delayed.  
Three weeks later, you return to the dealership to take delivery.  The dealership tells you they sold the car you leased.  They claim that the contract became null and void due to the fact that you did not take delivery of you car in a reasonable amount of time.
On contract law, there are 3 required rules for a contract to be legal:
OFFER - the dealer offers a car to you for a specific price.
CONSIDERATION - the price is $500 per month with $2500 due at signing.  You agree and give the required down payment etc.
ACCEPTANCE - even though you sign the contract a provide the monies (consideration), there must be provable acceptance - taking possession of the car.
If just one of the above requirements is not fulfilled, the contract is unenforceable and becomes null and void.
But, the dealer can offer you another car as a replacement for the same or similar terms, but the process must begin anew with new paperwork, signatures, etc.  the dealer is required to return your deposit so long as it can be proved that you could not accept delivery for the above reasons.
It gets complicated as you can see.  But you can refuse delivery (acceptance is not forthcoming) and thus the contract becomes void or unenforceable because ACCEPTANCE did not occur.
In your case, you have a signed contract to purchase a car at an agreed-upon price.  It also includes a trade.  I am sure your contract states that the trade is subject to reappraisal at time of delivery.

I don't think so unless the salesperson was going door to door like a Kirby salesperson and initially sold you the car that way. There was some concern years ago about tent sales and buyers backing out because they didn't buy the car at the dealers. Then it was determined (by a court I suppose) that the tent or parking lot sale was simply an extension of the dealer. Plenty of dealers made potential buyers do the deal at the store though, and probably still do.

And in the US, for the few things that do trigger a cooling off period, that period is three days.

Source? Just skimming posts here for a decade plus. Lots of AG sites talk about this though, like Georgia's.

There's probably some exceptions - NJ gives you a day to review lease contracts and California has something about used cars I think.","Driver, from what I understand, you have a contract with a dealer to buy a 2015 Mercedes E400 Sedan with certain options and a specific cash value trade allowance for your 2012 BMW 535ix.

First the Plasma crapped out on Sunday, after 8 1/2 years of flawless performance, so we took it to the dump and got a new Vizio 60 inch LED. (should have kept the Toshiba speakers as they were good). Now I need surround sound to make up for the poor Vizio speakers. Then today we had a new dish and receiver with HD installed which we like a lot.
Then I called on a tractor I've been bidding on for a while on ebay which expired (reserve not met). We agreed on a price including delivery from NC. When he got here I said I need more room in the garage since the tractor has a blade on front so he agreed to take my Polaris quad in trade along with $5.450 cash. Now the roll bar hits the garage door so I have to get a portable welding guy to shorten the bar about 3 inches. It's in the garage, but I'm afraid to back it out as going in just pushed the door up and backing out will tear the door out of the tracks. Oh well...you'll have that.","By the way, what's with all these blue colors on vehicles posted here. Is blue the new red? I saw a blue Ford F-150 XLT yesterday and that was a stunner.

We have opened up the new lanes of I-75 through Dayton after 3-4 years of repairs and moving the roadbed. You will be on the new 6 lanes or whatever that will end up being the southbound side. Part of it is being shared with the northbound giving them 2 lanes. But southbound you'll have 3 smooth lanes that will be the new I-75 through Dayton--at least until the next reconstruction starts. Probably 2 years after they finish this one.

Check out WHY Warren Buffett is getting into the car business. He says that new car sales are only part of the equation. Finance departments, Used Car Sales, & service make up a larger percentage of dealerships' revenue. If new car sales are down because of a slow economy, the dealership pays out less money in salary & commissions. A new car sale is the profit they make on selling the car, plus has the possibility of selling a warranty, & financing. Same with used cars, plus there is a much higher margin. If the economy goes bad, people keep their cars longer means $$$$$ for the service department.","If Del Monte can own funeral homes (back in the 1980's) throughout the country, why shouldn't Buffet diversify into car dealerships?"

I went over to the little Ford store about 3 miles down the road to see if they had a 15' I could at least sit in. (Ford website listed 1 2.3L turbo in stock).

No dice. Salesman in the totally empty showroom said they wouldn't arrive for a month and then he'd only have one or two available. Said ordering would be no problem but would take 8 weeks. Seemed strangely unconcerned if I bought something or not (had this same experience last time I visited this dealer). I don 't like high pressure but this guy seemed like he was on Valium. He didn't even ask about my trade or even look at my Eclipse which was parked just outside the door.

As I said, the showroom was empty, no customers except me and only one person other than me (a salesman I'm guessing) who sat at a little cafe table among the cars and played with his phone. I think this was the same guy GG saw at Lincoln. I wonder how they stay in business?

I had to almost ask the sales guy to take my info and he wouldn't have even got my email if I didn't volunteer it. Total 180 from the NJ dealer I had contacted.

So in the end I got some small questions answered which was helpful but I'm left still dreaming instead of buying.

I'd come that way but we would have to combine it with something to see (to get my wife to go...doesn't really like long car trips), and a place to stay that is pet friendly, for Gigi. A professional tennis match would work and Indian Wells is March 9 2015. We'll work something out!

When I lived in Palm Desert, CA, I had an apartment that was 1-1/2 miles from the tennis center in Indian Wells. I had 2nd tier center seats for all the matches.  The last finals match I saw there was Boris Becker (he lost).  He was an exciting tennis player to watch in action.
BTW, I live in far northern Broward County, or about 45-50 miles north of Miami.  I made it from St. Pete to my condo in 3 hours flat.  It's I-75 Soith to Naples area and then right across Alligator Alley to the Sawgrass Expressway.  No traffic lights from St. Pete to 2 blocks from where I live. 
An alternate route would be I-4 to the Turnpike and then straight south to a block from my condo.
They just opened a new hotel about 2 miles from me - I think they accept pets.  There are quite a few POI's in the area.  We have the largest indoor Mills Shopping Center here as well (Sawgrass Mills).  It is the second most visited POI in Florida, just behind Disney World.
I think the Key Biscayne Tennis Tournament is sometime in February or March.

Don't blame the salesman? At the same time that I talked to that idiot my nearest Ford dealer was selling every 5.0 they could get. A few other Ford dealers had waiting lists. And then here's this imbecile who doesn't want to even sell one V8.
The four cylinder take rate projection that you are referring to was made when the Fox body Mustang was introduced in 1979. The V8 offered at launch was a weak-kneed 4.2 liter boat anchor. Ford was pushing the base 2.3 Pinto I4 to penny pinchers and the turbo 2.3 I4 to enthusiasts. And even if the 1982 V8 take rate was 50% any dealer with a grain of common sense would have close to the same number of V8s and I4s.
The introduction of the 5.0 H.O. was BIG news in 1982 and that old coot at the L-M dealer was so clueless he would have needed a proctologist to find his head. It was obvious to me that his preferred clientele consisted of 5' tall blue haired ladies and geezers wearing Ban-Lon slacks with white belts and matching shoes.","I might just use a travel agent this time to book the flights as they have the wherewithal to sift through the multitude of seat availability, etc."

No, this dealer seems to be in love with Focus, Fusion and Escape. They have another lot down the road, maybe that's where they store them.

Lots of stuff going on.

Decided to go all in with my HVAC replacement. Getting new high efficiency gas furnace, A/C unit and water heater. Should get more savings from heating side than cooling.

In other news, a couple of years ago, I invested some money in our company. We are getting a new investor, so our current arrangement is getting cashed out.
Got a really nice return on the investment last year, but now I'm going to end up with enough after taxes to buy a nice 3 series.
Of course, visions of new cars are dancing though my head, but I'm going to pay off the Fusion, return the rest of the money I borrowed from our savings(plus some extra), and pretty much max out my 401k. Oh yeah, and set aside some money in case they let us invest in the new arrangement!
I'll still have a chunk left over and we'll see what happens after that. Last time I paid off a car without having another car payment, I bought another car within a couple of months. My wife is worried, which is good. I like to keep her guessing.

One of my kids was here on a business trip to meet her boss. One thing they talked about was having a face to face in person once a month. That means she will be here once a month, or once every other month, if her boss goes to her office. Nice way for us to keep in touch.

Not only that but travel between set cities are unique markets. As an example Edmunds airlines has a flight from New York City to San Franciso, that plane makes one stop in Chicago. Any combination of flights you can take (NYC to Chicago, NYC to SF and Chicago to SF) are different unique markets and priced accordingly. That means that the fare from NYC to SF can be less than the fair from Chicago to SF, even though it's the same flight and the same airplane.

Back in the 80's I had a boss that traveled to DC on a monthly basis, We would get a ticket for him on a flight from Denver to DC with a layover in Chicago and he would board the plane in Chicago. We did it that way because the ticket from Denver to DC with the layover was less than the ticket from Chicago to DC on the very same plane. That was due to each city combination being a different market.

This reminded me of something - not really the same, but related.

In 1979 I got my first job. It was with a relatively small dental supply house here. But the owner had aspirations of grandeur so he opened a second location in the Toronto market. He was under-capitalized and some weeks could barely make payroll - in fact I remember my paycheck being refused at the bank on a few Fridays. What a nice feeling when you are not making very much money and need that cash. The owner was not a nice guy and would do anything to make a buck.

One of the tricks he bragged about and did quite openly was using the airlines to get a suitcase full of product from one office to another for free. They would buy a ticket from Halifax to Toronto or vice versa, check in for the flight and provide the suitcase full of goods as checked baggage, then leave the airport and not get on the flight. Someone from the other office would go to the arrival airport and pick up the bag off the baggage carousel. Then the originator would get a refund for the unused ticket. Free air freight!

Of course that would not work now but in those days they did it fairly often. It was an awful place to work with those kind of ethics (that was just the tip of the iceberg) and I was glad to leave.","""btw....Mike, you seem better today...how are you doing?"""

so, catching up here.

From what I've read before, the tires on the Camaro 1LE are basically track tires (called ""cheater tires"" in some comparisons I've read). Yes, the tires make a HUGE difference compared to the stang. I'd also like to note a couple of other things. 1LE Camaro base price? $41,800. Stang PP? $35,420. I could put cheater rubber on the Stang, trounce the Camaro, and still have $5k change. And, lastly, not to ding poor Randy, but those cars were neck-and-neck up until exiting the last turn before the light bulb where he broke loose with the stang, making him completely botch the light bulb, hence the Camaro coming out quite a ways ahead from that turn to the finish.

I know I sound like a fanboy above. I just prefer fair matchups. To be more fair, yes, had the Mustang better tires, Randy could have made a better show of it. And had they equipped the 2 cars the same, the pricetags would have been more telling in the video. I'm also surprised by the close weights. I thought the Camaro was over 4k. I've read the next gen will be on the lighter platform from the ATS, so that could make things quite interesting.","I have tried to get USAA insurance, but it costs twice what I currently pay for Geico.

GG's experience makes me realize that all of us are somewhere on a scale when it comes to cars. At one end you have the extremely practical, it's-only-an-appliance person, who wants to minimize the cost of a car and has little love for them other than needing a certain set of characterirics. On the other you have the emotional, gotta-have-it type of person, who wants certain things in a car, be they luxury, performance, status, etc, and for whom finances are secondary to that emotional ""hit"".

I was never on the ultra-practical end of that scale, as I always loved cars and was never abig fan of the econobox or cheap used car. Now there were times in my life when I didn't have much money and had to buy cheap used cars, but even then I shopped for them with some idea of what I wanted stylistically or emotionally. At this stage in my life I can afford more flexibility in my choices, and so I am further towards the emotional end of the scale, though finances always play a role in my decisions. But I would not be changing cars every 3-4 years if it was all about the money. I get the itch and want something new after a while, and thankfully it is an itch I can afford to scratch.",HOLD EVERYTHING!  Car was supposed to have lane tracking a blind spot monitors standard.

I read recent reviews for the CR-V and RAV4. Reviewer said they were fine cars, but the Escape was a lot more fun to drive.

In fairness to Honda's CR-V, that AWD was tried in one very unusual situation, probably no one has come across that situation in real life.

AWD systems do vary though.

So, that begs the question, how do the Mitsu dealers survive selling so few cars? Looking around my metropolitan area, there's one Mitsu dealer.

If Mitsu is indeed selling 5K cares/mo in the U.S., that's about 1 car sold per day, per dealer. An entire dealer/store set up just to sell one car per day is a losing $$$$$$ proposition. I'm surprised they can hold onto their franchisees.",@driver100 said:

Well, here I am at the dealership returning the E400. They said they have ordered a new E400 for me from Germany, however it will not be here until the latter half of December. Additionally, they are giving me a brand new 2015 E350 to drive as a dealer loaner until the new one arrives. They added a $2800 option called ""Driver's Assistance Package"" which included Lane Tracking and Blind Spot Monitors as well as cross traffic monitors and assist (stops car if you are backing up into traffic or any object), Distronic Plus which is the radar controlled cruise control which adjusts speed and settings to match traffic pattern and will stop the car by self braking if a collision is imminent. I guess it has lots of other features as well.

Otherwise, the car will be identical to the one I had. Unfortunately, there are no cars anywhere near what I want with the equipment I wanted already built or on the ocean. They are putting dealer plates on the loaner car since my plates cannot be used on a car I do not own.

The new replacement vehicle MSRP's for $72,650, however they are giving me the car for the same price I paid on Saturday for the E400, which to me seems very fair.

My question to the guys here, as well as to Mercedes Benz USA in Montvale, NJ, is it possible that all newly produced E400's over the past month were produced exactly like this one - without the standard Lane Tracking and Blind Spot Monitros? No one bothered to answer that question even after I asked it several times.

It would appear that not only is Mercedes stepping up to make sure I am happy, but the dealership and management have gone above and beyond what one would expect from a dealer. They immediately went to bat for me.

So, while I am still here at the dealership, I thought I would update everyone about what has transpired. Thanks for listening. I guess this one goes down in history for me as being the most nerve racking experience I've ever had in buying and taking delivery of a new car.

I have a car-buying experience to relate!! It actually worked out better in the end than I expected it to. It is with the GM dealer I had mentioned last week, the one I leased my Buick from 3 years ago who had forgotten about me. So the ""Selection Specialist"" (no longer a salesperson) they assigned to me is one of their up-and-comers, been there a few years, already in their top 10, wants to be a lifer in the business. Honestly, I wasn't too thrilled with him at first, mostly because of his manner. He knew the product really well, probably better than any sales rep I have ever dealt with. Very professional in that regard. But his personal manner was a bit abrupt. At first I had the impression I was imposing on him whenever I asked him for anything. I didn't think it was going to go very well. That was made worse when he showed me the single 2014 ATS they had in stock. It was a very odd car, a 2.0T AWD with a sunroof and that's all. It didn't even have CUE. Plus it was an unattractive color called ""Majestic Plum Metallic"" that to my color-blind eyes looked like a very dark, drab gray. Because I didn't know the way Caddy spec'ed out their models, I asked if they could find a car with a light-colored interior. The only one they came up with was out of a dealer in Montreal, and it was white with a ""Caramel"" interior. He pressed very hard to get me to say yes to that on the spot, and to the $1000 fee to flatbed it here, saying they were going fast and I needed to commit. I wasn't sure about that color combo so I left, saying I wanted to sleep on it. That night I get home and do my research. The caramel interior did not appeal to me in photos. I discovered that the only interior color options come on upper level ATS models, with base limited to black or caramel. I decide black would be more acceptable to me than caramel. I start searching online and find a whole bunch of possibilities in eastern Canada. In fairness, because they limited their search to caramel interiors, they never showed up in what they offered me. I finally came up with a list of 5 cars that seemed suitable, and emailed it to him the next morning. After a couple of hours he called. Quickly he asked me which one of the 5 I wanted him to quote on. That turned me off a bit. But I did have a favorite, so I gave it to him. A while later he calls me back, throws out a price which was pretty good. We negotiate a bit, and a couple of calls later we have a deal. That was Wednesday. I get a call from their business manager that afternoon, we do the usual exchange of info, he promises me an email with confirming info. This is where the whole thing almost went south. I received no email, Thursday or Friday. No call either. Finally Saturday morning I get a voice mail from the sales guy, asking what time on Monday I want to come in to do the deal. I call him back, get his voice mail, give him a time and say I hadn't heard anything from anybody. Later that day I do finally get an email from the business guy with the info. I was still pretty unimpressed with their communications and honestly went there today ready to unload if things went awry. Fortunately, it was great. The business guy was awesome, no hard upsell at all, and because he said he made a mistake on something to do with the walkaway insurance, ended up giving it to me for free. In and out of his office in just a few minutes. The rest of it was good also - the sales guy was fine, his sales manager came over a couple of times and was gracious, and I was happy. About $7K off sticker, 54% residual, and exactly as we had agreed on everything. After the usual OnStar fooling around and a quick tutorial on all the features in the car, I left happy. Oh, the car? 2014 Cadillac ATS 2.0T AWD, Obsession Red Tintcoat, black interior, sunroof, polished wheels, CUE, surround sound Bose. Awesome car so far.

The convertible, only way that makes sense is if they got wires crossed, thought it was being traded in, and had a lowball on that factored in. though I suppose they could also have written the deal with an inflated APR and took that profit out too.

dealers just make it so much harder on themselves trying to play shell games. You wonder how many deals they lose, and if the times they take a patsy to the cleaners makes up for it.",But your friend's experiences are not uncommon in this business.  Dealership management will do everything it can to make as big a profit as possible even if it means lying through their teeth.

That's a prestigious name. Like bose. People know it and associate it with high quality, expensive stuff. Even if it is a lower end product the name still carries weight",That's why I like Edmunds.  At least you can go into a dealership with enough ammunition to walk out with a reasonably good deal on a new car.

@venture‌
FMC, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, etc., will advertise a 1.99% or 2.99% interest rate for highly qualified buyers.  In reality, the buy rate is at least 1% lower than the advertised rate.  I am sure of this since my experience in the car business has given me this insight after seeing it firsthand for many years.  
Let's say a buyer takes out a 60 month loan of $20,000 at 2.49%.  The dealership earns 1%.  That is $1000 back-end profit.  Often, more will be borrowed or the dealer bumps the rate another 1/2 percent.
As for the salesperson explaining it?  That rarely happens.  It's the withholding of information or downright ""lying"" that angers me about the typical run-of-the-mill dealership.
I have been quite lucky to have found a dealership that levels with me on every aspect of buying a car.  I am informed of the net buy rate of money if I want to finance, the net vehicle cost, actual wholesale values of trades (which they always add 1,000 - 2,000 dollars), and am kept in the loop rather than out of the loop.

This is the only way I can foresee Cadillac becoming more elite and exceptional - kind of like Mercedes, BMW, etc.  When a customer brings his/her car to service, it should be exclusively Cadillac and not a romper room for Malibus, Cobalts, Veranos, Enclaves, CTS, XTS, etc."

Here in Southeat Florida, within a 50 mile radius of where I live, there are 8 Mercedes dealerships, 6 of which are owned by AutoNation.  If you expand that distance to 75 miles, there are a total of 11.  For BMW, there are only 6 within 75 miles.  For Audi, there are only 5.  Cadillac has 18 dealerships - significantly more than the other luxury dealerships with most being stand-alone."

THIS DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT

Now here's the weird part. She said they had a price negotiated which was awesome what with end of year pricing, customer cash, etc. When they told the saleslady that they were not trading in their convertible nor financing the truck, the price went up $3,000.

Congratulations to GG and Drive100 on their new cars. I've been off and not posting for couple days while in hospital with wife who had her leg cut off and new knee inserted. Amazing what they can do. One night in hospital and she's home by 4 pm after surgery at 8 previous day. Someday this may be an outpatient procedure! I'm really glad to see the Cadillacs being considered by people and that they are finding them to be capable vehicles for their needs. Just pleases me to no end to see the stereotypes broken.","OK, now I understand.  The way you first described her experience sounded more like a Halloween trick or treat story."

I did take a little poetic license in describing that essentially your leg is useless after they take the knee joint out. But they slide the new metal replacement in. They used a spinal block, various anesthesias. They also put in a drip into the leg above the knee which will weep in anesthetic to block certain nerves through a fine hairsize tube. That comes out Saturday at home. That block along with oxycodone and tramadol every 4 hours has given her pain level from 4 down to 0 through last evening and parts of today. Also has an ice cooler pumping water through a butterfly maize laid over her knee since surgery to reduce swelling. This morning at 8:30 she walked, using a walker and alternating her legs almost normally, 160 feet to the therapy room where they train you on stairs, bathtubes, and other things you'll have to do at home with a new knee. Yesterday she could bend her knee back 126 degrees. Today it's about 120 due to swelling. She starts therapy 2 times a week for 4 weeks starting 2 weeks from yesterday. We have certain exercises to do to strengthen her ability to lock the knee joint straight and to keep the ability to bend and not let the muscle scarring set in. The first knee she had so much pain for first exercise sessions that the scar tissue started and had to work to painfully tear through it over 5 weeks to get up to 120 degrees.",I guess they do those knee replacements very differently today than 6 years ago.
