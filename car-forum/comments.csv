"June 18, 2014  3:53PM",graphicguy, i'm 2nd post....yee haw!!!!!!!! do i get a badge?
"June 18, 2014  4:01PM",bwia," great, but will it be possible to refer to old thread? and one more thing how do i find and add a discussion to ""my bookmarks?"""
"June 18, 2014  4:08PM",imidazol97," if you have posted in that discussion, click on ""participated"" and all your past post topics are chronologically listed. if you are looking for a brand or model or a keyword, use the ""car forums"" link at the top left of this page to get some ways of searching for models, brands, keywords, or poster names."
"June 18, 2014  4:21PM",stickguy," if you want to bookmark this one, there is a little 5 point star next to the title up above.  just click that and it turns yellow."
"June 18, 2014  4:43PM",bwia," thanks , it worked like a charm."
"June 18, 2014  4:49PM",bwia, thanks imidazol97. i will try that later but stickguy's approach works for me. thanks for that. while this new board loads faster it just seems a little cumbersome and not very user friendly.
"June 18, 2014  4:51PM",Kirstie_H," no, but it's almost like you're famous.  just think, if this discussion goes on for years and years like the other did, visitors loading this discussion for the very first time will see your name associated with the first member post.  and i gave you a ""like."" re the old discussion.  i'm not sure what will become of it.  this is the first one we're retiring on the new platform.  hopefully it can be archived."
"June 18, 2014  5:35PM",cdnpinhead," okay, here am i also.  now i need to add this to what shows up on my list. looks like i've done it. something tells me we won't get to 100k on this one anytime soon, but one never knows."
"June 18, 2014  5:39PM",graphicguy, wow!  i'm almost famous....... thanks......
"June 18, 2014  5:50PM",ab348," wow, that's a throwback to the old, old, old board software (well engaged? i forget its name) where you had to do this all the time to keep a discussion going after a certain number of posts. the more things change..."
"June 18, 2014  5:51PM",ab348, agreed. it is very dumb and complex at the same time.
"June 18, 2014  6:18PM",mako1a, we don't even have a page number yet. talk about new!
"June 18, 2014  6:25PM",laurasdada," well, you may be almost famous.  but are you a golden god, tiny dancer?"
"June 18, 2014  6:34PM",Michaell," having been through the archives just a few months ago, i saw all the discussions 'blah blah blah #6' and 'blah blah blah #7', where post #1 was a canned statement from the (then) host about this being a continuation. iirc, the limit then was pretty small (1000 posts?). at least with 100k posts before we have to close it down it will take some time. if we average 25 posts a day, that's about 9000 a year - would take 11 years to get to 100k posts again. c'mon, people, i'm sure we can average more than 25 a day."
"June 18, 2014  6:40PM",kyfdx, anyone have an actual story about buying or selling a car?
"June 18, 2014  6:41PM",houdini1," minnie pearl ""i'm just so proud to be here"" !!  probably not many will remember that one. at least i got on the first page."
"June 18, 2014  6:50PM",imidazol97, we were discussing what is the real invoice number. i believe the invoice numbers have been raised such as those shown in edmunds to fool the purchaser. it's my feeling profit margin at least double that indicated by the reported invoice. i operated on that basis negotiating my chevrolet purchase.
"June 18, 2014  7:17PM",graphicguy, ld....got the reference!!!!!
"June 18, 2014  8:04PM",stever," i bought one and sold two in the last 3 weeks. one sold with a sign on it and the other one went to a craigslist responder an hour out of town. the used van we bought came from a dealer 20 minutes away after we did a three day road trip down to wisconsin and test drove eight or so new car down there, and tested another 4 or 5 vans within an hour of home. i almost lost the local sale of my '97 outback. the buyer saw the sign, drove the car and went home and raided his strongbox, all within an hour. then i screwed up the title and had to wait until the next morning to talk to dmv (the joys of a small town, no line and the woman fixed it in 2 minutes). meanwhile the buyer was having a little remorse and thought he heard a wheel bearing noise. so i knocked $100 off and since then i've seen him cruising around a lot. he claimed he was going to check it out and then give it to his daughter, but the way he had shined it up, i bet he keeps it for himself. it was a great winter ride. the van ""sold"" sight unseen and while i was waiting for the buyer to drive the hour to my house to pick it up, i could have sold it to a local guy that was sort of a distant relation. that after it had been on craigslist a week and on the street with a sign on it for several days with zero interest. go figure."
"June 18, 2014  8:11PM",laurasdada," not yet.  but, i could retell my fabulous jos a. bank story! if only i had cashed in my 401k/ira prior to the greenwich concours..."
"June 18, 2014  9:03PM",graphicguy," not a sales story, but a sales question(s)/observation.  it's no secret that my two favorite brands of car are acura and bmw (not neccessarily in that order)..  bmw's are fair in retaining their value, hurt by the fact that bmw coroporate offers sizeable subsidies on their value to make the leases more attrative.  yet, they still sell for a premium on the used market. another one, acura, is known as being the brand that has one of the best resale values among all brands, have been discounting their car, as in the case with the new acura, over $10k off msrp.  so, the question here is, even though the previous rl was also heavily discounted, the resale value doesn't ""appear"" to be affected. am i missing a piece of the puzzle here?"
"June 18, 2014  9:27PM",Kirstie_H," it was 500 posts, so that's quite a few less than 100k.  it took us more than 8 years to get to 100k."
"June 18, 2014  9:34PM",driver100," well, i am the first person to post from london england. that joseph el banks story is going to get lost in  the archives. i may be the first person to post here using a ford tab10. all i can repo r t is there are lots of mercedes-benz benz here....about 15x as many as bmw!"
"June 18, 2014 10:45PM",kyfdx," i think it's been that way for a long time, though it may be getting worse.   for instance, bmw don't have ""holdback"", but it's common knowledge that there is 5% of invoice of back-end money that bmw pays the dealer (which varies by csi scores and volume).. and, some makes have such thin margins between msrp and invoice, that there has to be more money on the back end (volvo comes to mind)."
"June 18, 2014 11:57PM",imidazol97, i received a letter addressed to the previous owners of our home. it's from a company wanting to reunited them with their unclaimed funds from somewhere in exchange for 20% of the unstated amount. or they want to find their heirs for the same commission goal. i looked up the folks who used to live here and i find a mortgage company in florida and a sears amount in tx for more than $100 out of the states participating in the treasure hunt unclaimed funds page. none here in ohio for the folks. is it likely that's what the company is wanting to get 20% of? --something related to the mortgage? either insurance refund or a settlement from the large mortgage company? i hope i can find the folks to forward this information that there may be missing money owed to them.
"June 19, 2014 12:18AM",stickguy," speaking of missing money, recently someone that works with my wife said she saw out name on the nj missing funds list.  apparently there is a website where you can search by name to see what comes up.  she must have had some, so looked for other people she knew. and out name popped up. was obviously us, because the address was a bastardized mix of 1/2 our current, and 1/2 our last one.  and the date was in 1997, right around when we moved.  so, i filled out the couple of online question, and a few weeks later we got a legal looking form from the state.  filled that out, and got it notarized, and sent it back.  and yup, in a few weeks, a check showed up. i never did figure out what it was from (obviously related to the house closing), but it would have been exceptionally easy for whoever had the money to find us, if they ever bothered to look. instead, nj used our money interest free for a decade!"
"June 19, 2014 12:19AM",stickguy," and i almost had a shopping story today.  had to take my daughter over to the mall late in the afternoon to get a graduation dress (for her, not me!)  and we planned to stop at the volvo dealer, alas, it got too late, and the traffic at rush hour is nasty over that way, so we will have to do it some other time."
"June 19, 2014 12:24AM",imidazol97," is a group of several states that share their information on unclaimed funds. otherwise, check each state in which you lived or did business for unclaimed funds."
"June 19, 2014 12:25AM",ab348," the last 2 car i sold myself, i wasn't actually actively selling. in 2003 my fleet consisted of a '78 olds delta 88 4-door, a '79 buick electra 225 buick, and my '68 cutlass. yes, in 2003. i'll leave the cutlass out of this as it is a hobby car. for years when i lived and worked downtown, it was the only car i had. i walked most everywhere i needed to go. when i bought a house away from downtown in 1997, i needed a beater, and wanted a rear-drive car, preferably an olds since i was familiar with the engine. the '78 delta i found had a rocket 350, was in reasonable shape, and was cheap - $2000. after i got it i found, of course, that it wasn't as good as i thought, and i went on a project for a few years upgrading it inside and out, though mechanically it was really pretty good. by the time 2002 came along, it was more than presentable and not bad at all for a car approaching 25 years of age. it was a good runner too, as these car tended to be. in the fall of 2001 the buick presented itself, a total creampuff owned by an elderly gent who had given up the little driving he did, and it was a steal. i had to buy it. so now i owned 2 boats. i had the old fellow store the buick in his condo garage over the winter because i didn't want to drive it in the slop. in march, two things happened. he started bugging me to get it out of his garage, so i reluctantly parked it in my driveway and the olds went to the curb outside my house. about a week later, we had a big ice storm. i remember hearing a big noise outside that saturday morning, looked out the window, and saw a massive section of a maple tree that was next to the street, laying in the street, next to the olds. i got dressed and went out to look at it. the fallen section was big enough that it was blocking the entire street. when it gave way, it raked the drivers side of the olds pretty good, mashing the front fender, ripping off the door mirror, and doing some other assorted damage. it was a city tree, and after some wrangling with them, their insurance company agreed to go good for the repair. i found a similar car in a junkyard, got the necessary repair parts for short money, and came out about $1000 ahead on the insurance claim. so after it was repaired, it looked better than ever, with fresh paint on the drivers side of the car, but it wasn't getting much use since i was driving the buick. one day a knock comes at my door and there is a guy there wanting to know if that was my delta 88 and was i interested in selling it. he wanted it and i sold it for more than i paid originally. about a year later a similar thing happened. i was outside and a car pulls up. the guy gets out, wants to see the buick and after looking it over asks if i wanted to sell it. i did, and flipped it to him for a grand more than i had paid. he then went and had it professionally repainted, did some other small cosmetic things (it needed very little) and drove it for a while. i still see it occasionally around town, though he has sold it subsequently. it was nice to not have to work to sell two old tuna boats!"
"June 19, 2014 12:35PM",imidazol97, i am reading the online version and i'm confused by the title for an article in the cincinnati enquirer this morning maybe i need another mug of coffee.
"June 19, 2014 12:41PM",jsyodes," wait, this discussion is limited to buying and selling car?!?!  no razors, washing machines, air conditioners, etc?  i am outta here."
"June 19, 2014  1:29PM",stever," i made an offer on a house last night...er, on topic, it has a two car garage and i only have one car at the moment. on the way to lunch with the realtor, we passed by a brgish used miata with a tan top. if we were already living here (las cruces), i would have grabbed the phone number. have seen a dozen or so convertibles in the last couple of days but only two had the tops down."
"June 19, 2014  1:45PM",abacomike,
"June 19, 2014  1:45PM",Michaell, congrats on the (potential) new house! was it perhaps too hot to have the tops down on the convertibles?
"June 19, 2014  2:05PM",bwia," <b>  an exotic purchase may be coming soon </b> in an earlier post i mentioned that i was considering ordering a used car directly from japan for my caribbean home. i am using a local broker and he sent me the below link. i went through the website and this white 1999 automatic, two-door, 4wd model caught my eye. it looks clean inside and out, especially the headlights. the mileage at 60,800 miles seems very reasonable.  price, including cost, insurance, and freight (cif) us$ 4,600. like *driver100, i want to have my own wheels rather than spend $70.00 a day on rentals. it's a risk but one i am willing to take. any thoughts?"
"June 19, 2014  2:26PM",stickguy, looks nice enough. and not all that pricey.
"June 19, 2014  2:42PM",kyfdx, nothing to buy that's already on the island?
"June 19, 2014  2:51PM",bwia," yes, but it would be twice as expensive."
"June 19, 2014  3:26PM",graphicguy," interesting to note, while we were in bermuda last week (absolutely beautiful place, with wonderful people living there, btw), i struck up a connissantion with a person on the water taxi who has lived in bermuda all his life. he said they don't have a personal income tax on the island.  but, just as a ""for example"", if you bought a new car, you pay 130% of the u.s. retail.  hmmmn...no wonder everyone drives mopeds/scooters and teeny car there."
"June 19, 2014  3:35PM",robr2, it's more than that - it's a 150% tax and each household is allowed to own only 1 car.  there's also an annual road tax based on the vehicle size that ranges from $250 to $1600 a year.  the goal of course is to reduce congestion.  it's a tiny island.
"June 19, 2014  5:26PM",stickguy, been there 3 times. you really don't need a car.
"June 19, 2014  5:38PM",abacomike,
"June 19, 2014  6:05PM",justg0," &gt; the salesperson i dealt with at bmw said that the back-end money goes to the owner at year end, but it doesn't make it way down to the sales team. is that correct? in order to sell the car at invoice, he wanted to make sure i give them all 10s in the survey, which i guess helps them with some bonuses? and also the gm wanted to make sure i name our next child or grandchild after him"
"June 19, 2014  6:13PM",graphicguy," we had no problem whatsoever getting around on their public busses and water taxis.  i can see where no car is needed....maybe the scooters would be a nice convenience. i actually spoke to one of the residents who was running a jewelry shop (all hand designed) in st george.  she said she was looking to move.  as she put it, it is a tiny island, and everyone knows everyone else's business, to the point of intrusion. replying how i was shocked anyone would like to move from such a great place, the artist told me it was a scene out of ""twilight zone"" for her.....where she felt imprisoned by the island's ""tiny-ness"", regardless of its great beauty. moral of the story.....never assume paradise is as beautiful to live in as it is to look at."
"June 19, 2014  6:38PM",laurasdada," gg  i, too, was quite enamored of bermuda.  had similar intersting connissantions with the manager of a small art gallery in the hamilton princess hotel.  walked everywhere local in southampton and used the free water shuttle between the southampton and hamilton princess. i liked the odd (to me) assortment of small car, the iirc, the pugeout hard top convertibles.  or maybe renaults?  mostly, the relaxed atmosphere (when not in a taxi/van!), beautiful warm water and, as you noted, equally warm people."
"June 19, 2014  6:55PM",graphicguy," ld...saw the peugot covertible.  also interesting, saw modern mgs/rovers there, too.  surprised there were no ""smart"" car, though. found out they had a shortage of teachers (which peaked my wife's interest) and pharmacists.  ordinarily, they fill positions as much as possible with the natives.  but, as their saying goes there, the biggest bermudean exports are people anr rum.  so, there are opportunities for both.  unless yoiu're of bermudan ancestry, you can't own land.  and, as one south african pharmicist told us, she could have her work visa withdrawn at any time if things change.  but, she's been there 5 years, so far. we'll go back...probably sooner rather than later."
"June 19, 2014  6:57PM",stever," gee, it's only been in the high 90s and cloudless. don't know why the vert owners don't have the tops down. wasn't even any dust blowing around."
"June 19, 2014  6:59PM",sterlingdog," my claim to fame on this new site will be the fact that i arrived here all by myself and even bookmarked it successfully.  as most of you know, this is quite a feat for me! one feature that i like very much is that i now get those email alerts that new posts are on the site.  we had that nice feature under the older system. richard"
"June 19, 2014  7:04PM",laurasdada," i had similar converstaions regarding ownership.  as well as the relatively new concept of a measurable unemployment rate and the import of foreign workers.  and, of course, wealth! i hope to go back, with someone with whom i can share the experience..."
"June 19, 2014  7:06PM",imidazol97, congratulations. glad to see you're here.
"June 19, 2014  7:09PM",abacomike,
"June 19, 2014  7:25PM",stickguy, back in the 70s all the car in bermuda where british.  that was cool seeing them. most never  made it over here.
"June 19, 2014  7:55PM",Michaell," last year, my wife found a job posting for executive director of early childhood progdodges for bermuda. three year contract, paying something like $130k per year. we talked about it for, oh, about an hour before she decided she couldn't leave her dogs behind for that long. since my work is on-line, i could have easily made the transition and worked from ""home"" there. although, i'm sure there would have been many distractions."
"June 19, 2014  8:27PM",stickguy," speaking of rum, i still have a few bottles each of light and dark goslings 151 rum in the basement. from my honeymoon.  so quite aged at this point.  that is some powerful stuff.  rum swizzles that will burn your nose hairs."
"June 19, 2014  8:38PM",driver100," just a quick  thought from the uk.  remember, buying isn't as expensive as you first think, you will be able to sell your car one day too.  also, it is nice to drive a car you actually like.  go for it! btw....this using a tablet with british internet is almost impossible."
"June 19, 2014  8:43PM",driver100," yes, good work getting here richard. i also have trouble remembering the title of the new site.  i have to try to find it and bookmark it on 4 computers including this tablet....w n inch is a real challenge. btw....bermuda is beautiful.  i believe they produce electricity from using generators that are in the ocean....work off ocean currents.  sounds like quite a system."
"June 19, 2014 10:23PM",oldfarmer50," be real careful of avoiding any car from the fukushima area.  the ""glow"" on the paint may not mean a great wax job."
"June 19, 2014 10:54PM",robr2," unfortunately, that never got off the ground.  the company that proposed it was based in my town and it's founder is a prolific inventor.  but commercialization wasn't fruitful so the technology isn't being developed. bermuda relies on diesel generators powered by imported oil.  solar is starting to become a popular option as electricity is very expensive."
"June 19, 2014 10:59PM",oldfarmer50, but think of the wear and tear on your car delivering pizzas to the mainland.
"June 19, 2014 11:04PM",oldfarmer50," what am i missing?  who would spend that kind of money for a car with that milage...even a honda? not to mention that the seller is a dealer posting in the ""by owner"" section."
"June 19, 2014 11:44PM",stickguy," it's a stick.  so of course worth more! what can i say.  honda's get crazy money, even with lots of miles.  that one probably has a lot of life left in it too.  at least you don't have to worry about the at crapping out on you."
"June 20, 2014  1:39AM",graphicguy, no one shies away from big mile honda!
"June 20, 2014  1:43AM",graphicguy, michaell...that had to be a tough decision.   any particular reason you couldn't take the dogs with you?
"June 20, 2014  1:45AM",graphicguy, stick...did a rum cruise while in bermuda...sponsored bpy goslings.  that 151 put us back in our cruise cabin early.
"June 20, 2014  2:11AM",Michaell," we didn't look into it that closely ... and my wife was looking or a ""smaller"" job at the time, not a bigger one"
"June 20, 2014  2:54AM",stever," , missed your reply earlier - we hit the art museum today and enjoyed a ""small paintings"" from cheech marin's collection. we're heading back to the up tomorrow, having enjoyed a nice spell of ""mild"" weather here this week - don't think it got over 95. the ac on the '09 grand caravan we picked up a few weeks back is blowing nice and cold at 125k."
"June 20, 2014  1:37PM",bwia," in an earlier post i mentioned that i was considering ordering a used car directly from japan for my caribbean home. i am using a local broker and he sent me the below link. i went through the website and this white 1999 automatic, two-door, 4wd model caught my eye. it looks clean inside and out, especially the headlights. the mileage at 60,800 miles seems very reasonable. price, including cost, insurance, and freight (cif) us$ 4,600. like *driver100, i want to have my own wheels rather than spend $70.00 a day on rentals. it's a risk but one i am willing to take. any thoughts? excellent point but how does one verify that the car is not from that area? i believe the japanese government had placed a moratorium on the movement of people and property from the fukushima area to prevent such incidents. nonetheless, the price, appearance and mileage is extremely attractive to me, though one of my daughter's is dismayed that i would consider buying a 15 year old vehicle."
"June 20, 2014  2:14PM",graphicguy," michaell....we spoke about what it would take to pack up and move to bermuda (not very seriously).  sell my house.  packup and move belongings/car, etc 1200 miles to bermuda.  find a place to rent (not alowed to buy).  i can't even fathom what it would cost to move that much, that distance, over water. the wife could teach.  me?  not sure if i could do what i do there.  it certainly would mean a lot more traveling for me, if i could even swing it.  i told her i could set up a little shop over by the dockyards or in hamilton to sell internet service, water, etc.  i know there is a wifi provider by the cruise ship docks.  but, it's not very far reaching and pretty darn slow.  i know i could do better.  plus, selling refreshments and souvenirs sounds like a low stress job for me (something i'd welcome). hmmmmm????????  i wonder!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"June 20, 2014  2:15PM",sterlingdog," like your daughter, i,too, am a little dismayed that you would purchase a 15 year old car sight unseen from overseas.  i don't wish to dampen your buying spirit, but age is age.  though the appearance and mileage seem attractive, i would have to wonder about all of the inner workings and hidden parts.  what do you know at this point about the transmission, braking system, ac/heat system, undercarriage rust, etc.  another factor is that you can't run down to see the dealer if there is a major problem with your purchase.  i could be wrong, but i think that you are a bit unsure yourself.  remember---if in doubt, don't act.  best wishes with this decision. richard"
"June 20, 2014  2:40PM",sterlingdog," while you are wondering, i'll help you out a little on shipping your personal belongings.  one car will be around $2,000 to $3,000 and, depending on poundage, expect to pay a minimum of $5,000 for a small house load.  with furniture, it's often better to purchase new when you arrive in the country.  you can sell it to an x-pat if you decide to come home.  same with the car.  american car are often sought after to use as taxies.  personally, i would ship nothing and keep my home here, at least for 2 or 3 years.  if you decide to stay forever, you can sell your home here later.  during the interim, you can rent your home here or just put a monitor on it and watch it from bermuda.  rent in bermuda won't be cheap. teaching school there will be different.  moving to another country is a major decision---requires much thought and preparation. richard"
"June 20, 2014  2:53PM",Michaell," all excellent advice. in our brief discussion, we figured we'd keep everything we have in colorado - daughter would continue to live in it - and rent what we needed in bermuda. given that the wife's new salary would have been almost 3x what she was making at the time, we could have afforded a 1 or 2 bedroom place there. i was fascinated with the choice in car - lots of things not available in the us. though i suspect that a scooter would suffice for a majority of the transportation needs."
"June 20, 2014  3:27PM",graphicguy," richard and micheall....just day dreaming.  that would be a huge lifestyle change.  not that it would be a bad one.  but, i'm pretty tied to the lifestyle and geographic area i live in now. if i were in my 20s?  maybe even 30s?  no wife?  i could see myself chucking it all here and making that move, though. besides, i would own the biggest car on the island, as well as the most unique.  don't recall seeing any acura tls there. in the past i've given some serious thought to movign to puerto rico....u.s. holding, tropical climate, cosmopolitan area. when i was talking about that, friends asked why i just didn't move to florida. no offense to mike, but florida just doesn't ""do it"" for me."
"June 20, 2014  3:36PM",bwia," richard, you are indeed a wise man. to use *driver's banished word, i have a dilemma. my local agent suggested a 2002 rav4 with 35,000 miles for us $7,300 cif. (japanese car tend to be low mileage because of limited opportunities for long-distance driving). the killer (pardon the pun) of this deal is the additional local governmental charges in st. lucia that tacks another us $12,000 for customs duties, vat taxes and an environmental tax for vehicles over 5 years old. that's a total cost of almost us $20,000 for a 12-year old car. wintering in the caribbean is great but it can be an expensive proposition. oh, the price we pay for love (wife)."
"June 20, 2014  3:38PM",abacomike,

"June 21, 2014 11:26PM",stickguy," would not be surprised.  the 2015s are on the ground (i saw 2 of them thursday at the dealer, and they are very nice, and imo a big improvement), so the 14's are day old bread at this point.  still, they don't tend to have that many in stock, so a bit surprising they are knocking off that much (unless of course they are working off a dealer addendum sticker to cook the books). i should probably add volkswagen dealers to the list of places i better stay away from."

"June 22, 2014  2:50AM",stickguy," so richard, what are the prime contenders at this point? and i enjoyed watching the open last week and seeing shots of pinehurst.  looked like a beautiful town.  but probably horrible to be there during a major tournament."
"June 22, 2014 12:03PM",bwia," that's what i have been saying all along, that so-called ""invoice"" price is as phony as a three dollar bill. how can a company sell a product with a 5% or 15% gross margin and expect to survive? it cannot be done. the historical average gross margin for all american companies is about 40%, so what makes auto dealerships any different? a good example of that is to look at how the auto dealer service department price their services. the labor rate includes a base price plus a built in profit margin as well as an additional amount to cover overhead. the same formula is used for parts. the mark-up on parts includes an amount to cover both overhead and a built in profit margin. by extension, if we apply this pricing formula to the sale of the car itself we can see that invoice is quite meaningless. even the so-called experts, hondaing to usa today, said they didn't know what invoice is/was, yet they continue to publish this dribble."
"June 22, 2014 12:15PM",imidazol97," what has occurred is that the companies have insulated themselves from transparency in the pricing. they reacted to the publication of their invoice price and the other cost factors by developing other systems which the public has no ability to collect information about. lack of transparency. and they have good lobby systems. here in ohio, the law is written that allows dealers to collect a document fee, up to $250, on time contracts (loans). however, the dealers use that as a mandatory doc fee always at the maxiumum. they already have it printed on their contract. so someone paying cash doesn't need to pay any of it. but they get irritable when someone points out that deficiency and they start babbling about how they could be sued if they charge someone a different fee than someone else is charged. but that fee puts them in charge and mandates the buyer's having to work down from that rather than the dealer having work up to gleen that extra profit. here in ohio, the dealers are even trying to block tesla from using storefronts to sell rather than dealership buildings. can't have car being sold through stores like walmart or cvs, can we. tesla has 3 stores iirc. i can just see all the lobby money going to the legislators. my state representative will not respond to questions about the document fee and the tesla sales model and the dealer lobbying. almost like the irs. no wonder the stores can sell at invoice or below and build the new shiny showrooms they have and all the highly paid suits walking around while sales bots work their butts off. the gm stores have been improving their stores for 5 years or more, replacing or remodeling to get to white tile on the floor and a clean appearance."
"June 22, 2014 12:19PM",stickguy," well, look at it the other way,  no other industry even publishes the dribble.  so take what you can get!  but since it is common knowledge that the published #s are more of a ""show me"" trick, just shop for the lowest actual price (which is the bottom line that matters).  what the manufacturer is doing behind the scenes to support the dealer (keep the metal moving) is up to them. supply/demand and competition is still the driving force behind pricing. also, we always hear that new car sales is somewhat of a loss leader to get you into the dealership.  other stuff (used car, parts, service, f&amp;i) is where the real money is made, and you need the new car sales to front for all that."
"June 22, 2014  1:26PM",abacomike,
"June 22, 2014  1:51PM",imidazol97," do i interpret correctly what you've said to be that dealer invoice is a higher number because it includes money that eventually may be paid back to the dealer, holdback, trunk money, dealer incentives? the factory invoice number is a lower value where all the holdback and other incentives to be paid to dealer have been subtracted? and the edmunds number is really the lower of these two?"

"June 22, 2014  2:27PM",stever," my mil died a few months back and the estate is moving slowly. but there is a line of buyers for her '03 buick. the executor may have to go the sealed bid route to avoid making half the town mad (it's a small town). i'm not even sure the dealer owner knows the cost of a particular car until the books get closed at the end of the month or quarter. but having ""invoice"" price at least gives you a starting place to begin negotiations - $1,000 off invoice makes more sense to me than saying you want $3,000 off msrp. we're negotiating house buying right now and we're not head over heels in love with any house and there's no hurry moving, so we're in the driver's seat a little bit. but one seller is a bank with little interest in compromising and the other seller is our age and doesn't care if we buy his house or not. i think that means someone else is going to overpay, but i've overpaid before for the ""right"" house. over time, it's really not about the money."
"June 22, 2014  2:40PM",ab348, i thought banks didn't like having houses on their books and preferred to have cash? i would have thought they would be eager to compromise.

"June 22, 2014  2:48PM",stever," , you'd think so wouldn't you? but you're dealing with a ""bureaucracy"" not a motivated seller. they countered and we've had longer buyer's remorse than usual, so we're going to keep looking. , exactly. we begged our landlady to sell for six months, and paid $5,000 over appraisal in '84 on a modest home in anchorage (great neighborhood though), and financed it at 13%. we were underwater for 7 seven out of the 15 years we lived there and we broke even when we moved. it was perfect for us at that time in in our life and we never lost a bit of sleep over owning it."
"June 22, 2014  3:32PM",mako1a, it's not the amount they paid that makes a buyer happy...it's knowing he got it for 1 dollar less than the last guy.

"June 22, 2014  5:31PM",sterlingdog," as we were told, the funeral was on sunday with an estate sale set for the next saturday which included the mb and the honda.  at the end of the day all had disappeared.  the house itself is in a court battle.  the house was left to the statue of  subaru foundation.  the two children contested, so the house just sits there.  personally, i hope the foundation wins the case.  those two children are what i would refer to as ""pluckers of pockets"" and ""pursuers of the purses"".  i'm being nice because we are on a family channel here. richard"
"June 22, 2014  5:43PM",isellhondas," why should car dealers be ""transparent""? why should car buyers know exactly what a dealer paid for a car? if you buy a new camera, jewelry or construction material, you don't know this nor should you. when i buy something i don't care what the store paid for it.  i only care if that item represents what i think is value for my dollars spent. car dealers are fed up with invoice buyers and it sounds like the manufactures are finding ways to build some back door profit into the car they are building. good for them!  a merchant has to make a profit in order to pay overhead and stay in business."
"June 22, 2014  5:59PM",sterlingdog," you watched the open and you didn't see me? we had tickets for one day so we drove over.  we saw the first hole in person, watched the remainder on the clubhouse tv with food and drink, and then went outside the back door to watch the 18th hole in person.  it's the lazy man's way, but my wife and i can't take that heat and humidity now that we are older.  believe me, you don't want to live there during an open.  we lived in pinehurst during the last open and it was the nightmare from hell.  no way we could eat in a restsaturnnt or get into a grocery store for two weeks.  they even closed the road to our housing development and routed us out the rear entrance which meant driving five miles out of the way to get back where you intended to go. some people rent their homes to news crews for $10,000 a week and go on vacation until the open has ended.  there is a downside to that you often come home to a trashed house and have to file an insurance claim for damage repairs.  those news guys will throw a party or two.  we got a couple of offers because our house was one mile from the airport.  we had formed a pact with our neighbors----no takers in our neighborhood. prime contenders at this point?  ford ford crew cab xlt, chevrolet 1500 silverado, honda honda, jeep grand cherokee, and caddy cts.   wife has relented on the pick up truck which thrills me to no end.  i've wanted a truck for years.  color choices for the trucks are ruby red metallic or oxford white.  interior colors---cocoa tan or alabaster gray.  it's fun looking right now.  will keep you posted. richard"

"June 23, 2014 12:32AM",stever," i've haggled at nordstrom's and do it at motels all the time. just have to ask the right person and no worries if the answer is no. years ago i knew a site that would tell you what a builder was paying to build a house, so you could get an idea of the materials and labor cost and figure how much profit the builder was making. from the  our tmv pricing system estimates a vehicle’s average transaction price, not its “out the door” cost. therefore, tmv prices do take into account any incentives and fees that may affect the transaction price, including •manufacturer-to-dealer incentives (i.e. dealer cash) •destination charges •advertising fees (when applicable) however, tmv prices do not include the following incentives and fees that are typically applied after a transaction price has been determined •manufacturer-to-consumer rebates (i.e. cash rebates) •sales tax •license/registration fees •dealer title/documentation (“doc”) fees"

"June 23, 2014  1:31AM",robr2," busy time here last sunday - father's day - i coached my buick team in 3 games in one morning.  the girls played great and it was a great end to the season. last weekened - father's day weekend - my son ran in the new balance outdoor nationals in greensboro, nc as part of a distance medley relay team.  they took 9th place overall, set a new school record and my son set a personal record in the 800 m portion.  two other boys were all americans - one in the 5k setting a school record and another in the 1 mile race walk also setting a school record. this week - my daughter is finishing middle school and had so many activities and ""graduation"" on monday. this past saturday was my son's eagle scout court of honor.  he and another boy combined their ceremonies.  my son was given a commendation from our town naming yesterday ""son of robr"" day!!  it was pretty funny. next week - focus on work and try to make some money."

"June 23, 2014  1:10PM",bwia," i posted this on the buick buick forum but i thought i'd share it on this thread as well. •   the buick appears small in pictures but the interior is very comfortable for four adults. at 6 feet tall and 248 pounds, i have no problem fitting in the driver's and front passenger's seat. i thought i would be compromised in the back seat but there is plenty of head, leg and knee room. •   the sunroof is small and feels like a hole in the roof. a panododgeic moon roof would be more desirable. •   i drove the buick under different road conditions. on the highway, it was silky smooth and quiet, maintaining speeds of 65 mph without the buzzing i would have expected in a 4-cylinder engine. in city driving the buick actually felt very quick because of its low end torque orientation. at times it felt like a spritely sports sedan rather than a suv. •   on roads with portholes and imperfections you could feel the jolts and hear the thumps. compared to my buick it felt harsh and unrefined. blame that on its short wheel base of 100 inches and 18-inch tires •   front visibility is quite good but not so for rear visibility. this weakness is mitigated somewhat by the back-up camera. but without directional and distance grid lines the camera is not as not as effective as it should. a major demerit for gm. •   we had a major concern whether the tiny 1.3 liter 138 hp engine could climb steep hills without petering out but the buick handled those hills (with the ac on full blast to boot) with aplomb. •   two areas of concern--the steering felt soft and the breaks a little mushy. i did not like the feel of either. they were just too soft for me but my wife thinks they are just right. since she is the primary driver i have no quarrel with her assessment. •   the gas mileage is very good. after a week's worth of driving (not sure how many miles) the tank is still 1/3 full. •   the technology on this baby buick is amazing---back-up camera, blind side detection, front and rear parking sensors and intellilink. the intellilink looks a little intimidating but all major functions can be activated by voice control. in terms of the weather and traffic navigation, we were not sure whether the signal came from sirius/xm or from gm's intellilink. (does anybody know?) •   one final comment. while the buick is pricey, its interior refinement is very upscale (especially the saddle leather) and it addresses very well the interests of one of its target demographic, the empty nester."
"June 23, 2014  1:52PM",graphicguy," richard....i've always liked ford.  last pickup i bought was a good long while ago, and was a toyota tacoma.  drove in a friend's ford at the time, and immidieately knew i should have bought the ford instead. there's a reason that it's been one of the top selling vehicles, across the board, for such a very long time.  ford puts a lot of engineering and thought into the ford, and it shows.  the fact that you can get a nice one for $8k off....pretty compelling!"
"June 23, 2014  1:54PM",stever," , apparently the rh in places like phoenix has gone up over the last several decades due to all the grass getting watered in the 'burbs and on those volkswagen courses. my nose still takes a week to acclimate out there. boise was pretty ideal for a convertible, only had a few weeks out of the year where the temps would hang around 105°f. got home to the up yesterday afternoon; first dry day in a week the neighbors said. got the grass mowed and even after that exercise, i had to go in and turn on the furnace since the house was 63°. drizzle and fog right now. so, miata's have strong acs, right? , re the backup camera, my newer used van has lots more bells and whistles than our old one, but i'd love to at least have rear parking sensors. that feature saved me in a rental buick in chicago one year when i almost backed into a pole."

"June 23, 2014  6:37PM",ab348," was at the dealer this morning for routine service on the buick turbo. no issues discovered although they tried to convince me to spend $92 for them to install a new air filter. no thanks, the neighborhood parts store has them for $17. i waited in the showroom for the car and looked around of course. they had a black silverado ""foose"" edition which i can't say i liked - a big black cow-catcher hoop on the front (bumper protector? ), big wheels that weren't too bad i guess, and a coal-mine black interior with perforated leather seat. the thing is huge of course. didn't see a price sticker on it. also a new cts there, black/black also, 2.0 turbo, awd, no sunroof. i sat in it and liked it although the black interior was pretty dingy and i would never buy it in that color. don't know if i'd order one of these with that engine either. they also had a black (what is it with this outfit and black vehicles?) chevrolet ltz there, 20"" wheels, v6, and nice saddle leather seat although it was mostly black inside otherwise. big car though, maybe too big for me. also a chevrolet v6 convertible, red with black interior again, can't see black interiors in a convertible though, too hot in the sun. to complete the black equation they had a black chevrolet ltz 4-door with black interior as well, nothing special. oh, and a red chevrolet with a black interior. they apparently order most in-stock vehicles with black interiors because they think they are easier to sell. i dunno about that. while i was sitting there an older gent came in driving a buick lucerne, not sure of the year, and started to deal on a new verano, the old fellow had done lots of online research, knew exactly what he wanted, and made them work to find the car in the color he wanted - mocha bronze with cashmere leather, no black interior for him! they went back and forth a few tines but in short order they shook hands on the deal. they are doing ""employee pricing"" here right now and that seemed to be the clincher for him. i was surprised by how quick it all went. yesterday i gave the buick a hand wash and detail, so i thought i'd post a pic of it from when i got home from the dealer. this was midday so the sun was directly overhead, sorry about the harshness."
"June 23, 2014  6:41PM",graphicguy," great analogy, shifty! point made, although they do get into the ""extended warranty"" game on tvs and appliances. but, you're right about dealerships today.  they seem to like playing a little ""hide and seek"" on whatever the final price is going to be on the car.  doc fees, tire warranty, maintenance plans, lug nut locks, etc, etc, etc. every time i hear ""i have to charge the doc fee.  it's a law.""  for years i've been asking them to show me the law they're referencing.  have yet to have one find it for me. what you agree to at the sales person's desk ordinarily doesn't even remotely resemble what you are actually paying for the car once you get through all the ""add ons"", f&amp;i, doc feel, etc.  which again, is why i make one offer only, and it's all inclusive.  i know exactly what i'm paying before i leave the sales person's desk....including tax, down to the penny."

"June 24, 2014 12:31PM",robr2," unfortunately, with a condo purchase both the buyer and the building/association have to meet the lender requirements.  she is finding attractive pricing in some developments because of the high foreclosure rates which makes it more difficult to qualify the development. my suggestion  look for more stable developments."

"June 24, 2014  2:33PM",fushigi, here's a mini tutorial for copy/paste on android.
"June 24, 2014  3:13PM",Mr_Shiftright," what i meant was that the $40 seems like a lot for 5 minutes, but his knowledge allowed him to do the job in 5 minutes. i think i misinterpreted your reaction. i thought that you thought that $40 was a lot of money for 5 minutes work, so i was defending the fee because it solved the problem. you see this dilemma quite a bit in auto repair, where the experienced mechanic ""beats"" the flat rate by a considerable margin and still charges you the flat rate. some folks think this unfair but again, if it took him 20 years to learn enough to beat the flat rate, more power to him. of course, this presumes that he's actually doing the job he is supposed to. if he can do a 10 hour clutch job in 5, with his know-how and fancy tools, then fine. but if he fixes a leaking hydraulic line and calls it a ""clutch job"", that of course is dishonest."
"June 24, 2014  3:30PM",robr2," there are thousands of variations to the story but this sums it up there was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things mechanical. after serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired. several years later his company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. they had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. in desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problem in the past. the engineer reluctantly took the challenge. he spent a day studying the huge machine. at the end of the day he marked a small ""x"" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated, ""this is where your problem is."" the part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. the company received a bill for $10,000 from the engineer for his service. they demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. the engineer responded briefly one chalk mark......................$1 knowing where to put it........$9,999 it was paid in full and the engineer retired in peace"

"June 24, 2014  5:55PM",bwia," she has an 811 fico score and only $1,100 in consumer debt. one lender told her that with her impeccable credit history she would qualify for a mortgage with only 5% down. she could put more money down if she tapped into her 401(k) but is reluctant to do so at this time. the big hang-up with financing is the percentage of owner occupied units in the condo development/s. if it is below a certain percentage lenders won't budge. in some sectors of the housing market prices have rebounded appreciably but in others where owners are upside down they simply choose to walk away thus creating a vicious circle. mike, based on your suggestion she will try to see if the lender will entertain the idea of a cosigner. my wife and i are both willing to cosign for her and return take her off our will."
"June 24, 2014  6:29PM",robr2, give it a shot but i wouldn't expect that to work.  the building doesn't meet the standards needed for fannie mae or freddie mac so your co-signing won't change that.  unless of course the bank is planning to keep the loan for it's portfolio but that's rare nowadays.
"June 24, 2014  6:33PM",abacomike,
"June 24, 2014  7:55PM",cdnpinhead," i'd throw in with the notion that the upfront money (down payment) would need to be greater when the development/developer is ""questionable."" if she's planning to be there awhile and the building(s) are sound and in a good location, she can probably ride it out but needs to be prepared to put more down."

"June 25, 2014  1:19PM",graphicguy," kirstie....your comments about the high school reunion made me chuckle.  i never went to mine.  i was fairly popular, prom court, homecoming court, played sports, etc.  i was one of the few who enjoyed high school.  i just never saw the need, nor want to see the ""old"" school, old friends, old girlfriend(s), relive those days. my wife, however, is into that.  funny, as pretty and desireable as she is, she felt she needed to ""lose a few pounds"" to fit into her wedding dress.  i certainly didn't see the need, in any way shape or form.  but, she had invited some of her high school and college friends to the wedding. that was the key....looking good, not only for me, but in front of her one time piers. must be a female thing.  i ate a cinnebon the day before our wedding and didn't think twice about it."
"June 25, 2014  1:27PM",sterlingdog," your post on checking to see if the crew cab would fit in the garage was certainly a timely one.  the day that you posted was the day i found out the answer----the hard way!  after looking at many trucks, i found exactly what i wanted ford ford xlt 4 door with rwd in beautiful ruby red metallic with tan interior and included the luxury package with rear camera, rear sensors, powers seat, nav, etc.  my salesman turned out to be a former student who insisted that i take the truck and enjoy it for a few hours.  i drove it both in and out of town and did the mall parking.  i then went home to try the garage---bad mistake.  i managed to get it in the garage with maybe 4 or 5 inches on each side.  realizing that this wasn't going to be a good daily fit, i pulled out of the garage.  as i did, i scraped the right side mirror against the brick pillar which divides the garage into two halves!  i was mortified.  the two streaks on the black casing didn't look too bad, but the damage had been done.  i drove back to the dealership and confessed what had happened.  my salesman looked a little worried but was as nice as he could be.  he asked the gm to come out and take a look.  naturally, i offered to pay for the damage and i apologized profusely.  the gm was extremely kind and courteous.  he said for me not to worry, that they would take care of the repair.  still, i insisted that he allow me to pay for the repair.  his response was to just come back and buy a vehicle when i was ready.  wasn't that nice of him?  my salesman and former student walked me to my car and was also very courteous and kind.  what a day that was; i was so embarrassed. i've called a contractor that i know to see if we can modify the center brick pillar on the front of the garage.  even if it's a load bearing pillar, i wonder if it could be made more narrow to accommodate the truck.  at the same time, i don't want to destroy the integrity of the house .  still, i don't know how the original house owner put those car from the 50s and 60s in that garage.  car back then were like gigantic boats.  we'll see what happens.  after what happened, we didn't bother to negotiate on the truck, though i was ready with my research and figures.  they did drive my convertible but i never asked at that point for any figures.  to tell you the truth, i was ready to go home and have a drink!  also, i'm sure that i don't have to relate what my wife said about the incident. as mack would say, this story is definitely to be continued. richard"

"June 25, 2014  6:22PM",houdini1," one more suggestion.  i know you want an american made vehicle, but you should at least drive a 4 door toyota tacoma. i believe they are actually made in san antonio, tx. for me, they are just the right size. no garage mods needed, plus it is very comfortable, costs less, gets better gas mileage, and will hold its value like mad.  if you love the tacoma, just pay for the ford repair to clear your conscience."

"June 25, 2014  9:30PM",imidazol97," you are right. i read that as power for folding. i assumed all mirrors are power controlled these days. but you are right. i dug through more of the ford brochure and you have to get a lariat or fx2/fx4 model or some options higher than the xlt i was looking at to get power-folding mirrors. but looking at the specs at the end of the pdf brochure, lower line models with mirrors are 97 in and with mirrors folded are 83.5 in a savings of 13.5 inches. big difference."

"June 26, 2014 12:08PM",ab348," in either 1983 or 1984 i saw a newspaper ad from one of the local chrysler dealers with a screaming deal on a new lebaron 2-door - the little k-car based one. one evening i went to see the car. they showed it to me and it didn't look bad - sort of a creamy yellow outside, half-vinyl roof, gold or tan interior, wire wheel covers, rather nice-looking. i took it for a drive and it was ok, nothing special - these were essentially k-car with a bit more sound insulation and nicer trim, so it was a rather underwhelming drive, but nice enough given the pricing. i stopped in a shopping center parking lot under one of their light standards to look it over on the outside (it was dark by the time i drove it). without a whole lot of effort i was able to see that the passenger side had been repainted - there was a tiny but of overspray in a few spots and it was missing the pinstripe that the other side had. clearly the car had sustained damage. it annoyed me that they hadn't mentioned this so i returned to the dealer and raised it with the salesman. he pleaded ignorance but could not explain the damage or tell me the extent. with that i lost all interest and left. seems to me they would have been better off up-front coming clean about it rather than have a prospective buyer like me think that it could have had serious damage under the skin."

"June 29, 2014  3:40AM",ab348," i mentioned that i had the buick to the dealer for service last monday and they recommended an air filter change for $92. i passed. so today i went to the neighborhood parts store and picked up the filter, a fdodge, for $16.50. replacing it involves loosening a half-dozen torx screws (thankfully i had the bit) and freeing up a couple of clips. the original filter was made in france but looked identical to the new fdodge otherwise. here's what cheesed me off when the car was at the dealer i paid for the extra service that involves checking filters and fluids, oiling hinges, making sure bulbs aren't burned out, rotating tires, etc. i know its a profit pack for them but i don't mind that, at least i get some peace of mind. this is where they found the air filter needed changing, and in fact they said it had bugs and twigs in the housing. at $92, i passed. today when i did it i found removing the lid on the housing was the toughest part. i guess gm determined its cheaper to use 6 torx-head screws than a few spring clips, but they are time-consuming and there are still a couple of plastic clips you have to wrestle with. but finally i popped it off and removed the air filter. this is what pissed me off the twigs and bugs were still there! after going through all the trouble to remove the housing at least he could have blown some compressed air into it to get rid of the debris. but instead they wanted to charge me the time to again remove the housing and then replace the filter. ridiculous. i really should write a letter to the dealer principal. if they had paged me when he found the junk in the housing and said , ""you need a new air filter, the part is (say) $30"" i would have said yes. but not at $92. greedy bas*ards."

"June 29, 2014  1:26PM",stickguy," the only thing with filters that worries me is that while the same company makes it for wally world, they are doing it to a different price point and minimum specs.  so the outside may look the same, but they may have cut corners on the inside.  the oil if anything is more likely to be a straight relabel. stuff like filters really don't cost much more at the parts counter, and you replace them so infrequently that an extra few $$ is not a big deal.  i do however save money on the cabin filters buying them at walmart!"

"June 29, 2014  1:38PM",ab348," oh, i agree, this had nothing to do with gm. this dealership group owns dealer operations for  toyota, m-b, nissan, hyundai, kia, and god-knows what other makes here. i'm certain this is their service management policy. they have (or had) a decent reputation here, certainly better than their main competitor, but this is the second or third time they have disappointed me in the last 2 1/2 years. my point is, i was already paying them $89 to do all these inspections, etc. the guy did the hard part of the job by removing the housing. he had the dirty filter in his hand. i know because what they described they saw is exactly what i saw. i was sitting 100 feet away in their lounge. they could have paged me and asked, and sold me an oem filter at list price. but that $92 must include a hefty labor component, which i had already paid for. as for oem vs aftermarket, i am generally an oem guy. i will only buy oem wiper blades, and i prefer oem oil filters, especially after that analysis years ago on the cheap state of fdodge oil filters at the time (maybe they have improved since, i don't know). when i had my intrigue with the shortstar engine i bought a case of delco oil filters for it, and i did the same for my '68 cutlass. i know lots of folks with volkswagens, m-bs, honda, etc that will only use the oem oil filter and i have no issue with that. air filters i am less concerned with. i figure if people are paying big bucks for k&amp;n air filters that probably let more stuff into the engine, then an aftermarket air filter that looks and appears identical to the original which was not made by gm anyway probably will work fine. it was just the sales tactic in this case that irritated me."

"June 29, 2014  1:43PM",stever," that filter housing ""analysis"" a while back was a joke. it's all about the media. fdodge is owned by reynolds (of aluminum fame) and they also happen to own some paper mills. if fdodges were so bad, the consumer protection agency would be all over them. ( <strong>  the </strong> consumer protection agency being, of course, the american trial lawyers assn. ). about the only oem replacement part i'd really want on my car are the shocks."
"June 29, 2014  1:50PM",imidazol97," only their advertising has improved to try to make people ""feel"" better about their brand. the bobistheoilguy analyses were good stuff. wish someone would repeat them with more current materials. as for the oil filters, the more they use data in the advertising to make me feel guilty that i need to use their better filter, the less i react. getting 99.1% of particles is great. i don't need to pay double or triple to get 99.6% of particles. the ones getting through are so small they don't matter. further, the oil filter matrix catches some particles that block some of the larger pores after time. the filter then becomes what the finer, smaller matrix of the higher-priced filter was at the start. so a used filter actually filters ""better"" because it will have a smaller average opening size. however, the downside is that the finer filter restricts the oil flow more. this in turn causes more of the oil to go to the bypass valve on the pump or the filter and circulate without being put through the filter material. this is more true with colder oil. so my logic is a standard purolator filter is better for my car which is driven on a combo of short trip with colder oil and on longer drives with hot thin oil. i do buy the purolator one which is a finer matrix for my chevrolet which gets only pennzoil platinum full synthetic and i change the oil once per year even though it doesn't make the mileage needed for a change."

"June 29, 2014  4:36PM",abacomike," <strong>  rolls royce coupe? </strong> dad and i went to the boca raton town center for our daily walk.  as we passed by the rolls and bentley exhibit, i noticed there was a new rolls royce coupe sitting where the ghost used to sit.  i walked over and saw the pricing - $369,000.00.  the doors opened by front out first, not rear as you would expect.  the color was brown quarter panels and beige hood and trunk and brown cabin top and medium beige leather seating. <strong>  it was exquisite! </strong> i have never, ever seen a more beautiful car.  there were at least 20 people walking around it and remember, the mall stores are closed until noon and we were there at 1000 am. it was a breathtaking automobile.  i did not see any insignias on the car to show the model, so i assumed it was a corniche or some special edition ghost in a coupe.  $369,000 is a bit low for a corniche or a phantom - they retail in the $450,000 - $500,000 range. when i got home, i looked it up on edmunds to find out the model.  it's called the ""wraith"" and pricing starts ar $289,000.  so the one they were showing at the mall ($369,000) was obviously <em>  loaded, loaded, loaded! </em> i can't tell you how beautiful that car is in words - you really have to see it and examine it's stance and lines to truly appreciate the elegance and styling.  so much nicer than the bentley coupe. my guess is that you would have to pay a bit more than msrp to get the one they were exhibiting only because there is almost a 1 year wait if you order one.  and then, you have to add the luxury tax and gas guzzler tax.  again, all i can say is ""breathtaking!"""

"June 29, 2014  5:01PM",henryn," going back many years, i remember all of the hoopla about fdodge filters being junk.  as i recall, the only real problem ever encountered with fdodge filters were that some models which should have had an anti drain back valve, did not.  this could cause lifter rattle on cold start (and quite possibly more wear on the lower end of the engine). i’m fairly certain that this problem was corrected many years ago.  i will admit to a certain lingering prejudice against fdodge, and for oem oil filters."

"June 30, 2014  3:25PM",oldfarmer50," you might need more than shocks and bushings to get a true speed6. starting with the basic mazda 6 structure--a unibody with good rigidity credentials--mazda added a cross brace behind the rear seat and a hefty cross-body beam under the dash, heavied up the mounting points for the front and rear suspension subfdodgees, and beefed the a-pillar anchor points. the net of the foregoing, hondaing to mazda, is a 50-percent gain in torsional rigidity. sounds extravagant, but we failed to pack a structural-rigidity test rig and thus must take the company's word for it. as you'd expect, the suspension--unequal-length control arms in front, a multilink rear--has been stiffened, with higher spring rates, firmer shock damping (monotube at the rear), harder bushings, and heftier anti-roll bars fore-and-aft. heftier also applies to the brakes, which spin behind 7.0-by-18-inch alloy wheels (versus 7.0-by-17 on the mazda 6 s). power is supplied by a revised mazda mzr 2.3-liter dohc 16-valve four, said revisions including a block cast from higher-density aluminum alloy; a reduced compression ratio (9.51 versus 9.71); a steel crankshaft with enlarged crankpins; direct (versus port) fuel injection, a first for a u.s. mazda; and a hitachi turbododge compressing the air-fuel mixture to the tune of 15.6 psi via an air-to-air intercooler mounted squarely atop the engine."

"June 30, 2014  4:54PM",graphicguy," oldfarmer...i hear you.  but, he has enough backing to get elected (which is something i could never muster).  so, i'll give him some cred on that count.  and, you have to admit, oil is running out of bogus excuses for raising prices. that doesn't change the fact that price manipulation has, is,  and will continue to go on as long we we let it.  i think boehner is tired of getting my phone calls and emails every week on this topic.  his office now only sends me generic form letter replies. i've been wondering about the whole oil export policy change, too.  assuming oil companies, with a surplus here in the u.s., are looking for foreign avenues to sell their products. you want an economic boom?  we're coming to an end to over a decade of war.  add low oil prices to that equation and see what happens (think mid-90s economic expansion). however, can't happen until the few who are manipulating oil prices are brought to task."
"June 30, 2014  5:00PM",imidazol97," you want an economic boom? we're coming to an end to over a decade of war. add low oil prices to that equation and see what happens (think mid-90s economic expansion). i thought we have been exporting refined products all along, at the same time raising prices on the finished products here--diesel fuel was the one i recall as the example. odd that we block drilling in most of the source areas and then export finished product and now export unrefined oil. huh? and the media does no digging into facts as to what's going on. i thought it was all bush and cheney's faults for 8 years. they're gone. now the media follows bernie that it's all just a few manipulators? at least they can't blame bush. media'll have to update their perpetrators list to more correctly fit the current admin. on the topic of car, i was at a joe nuxhall miracle league car show in your neck of the woods (hamilton/fairfield) sunday. lots of car i hadn't seen further north nearer dayton, along with bond's aston martin from goldfinger (1 of 4 and it had sold for north of $4 million) and miss ohio 2013 was there."
"June 30, 2014  5:31PM",Mr_Shiftright, fuel is america's largest export product i believe.
"June 30, 2014  5:53PM",robr2," in 2013, us exports were machinery $213,108,199,000 (13.5% of total exports) electronic equipment $165,604,449,000 (10.5%) mineral fuels including oil $148,426,743,000 (9.4%) vehicles excluding trains and streetcar $133,640,479,000 (8.5%) aircraft and spacecraft $115,380,944,000 (7.3%) optical, technical and medical apparatus $84,281,276,000 (5.3%) pearls, precious stones, precious metals and coins $72,830,232,000 (4.6%) plastics $60,836,970,000 (3.9%) organic chemicals $46,510,903,000 (2.9%) pharmaceutical products $39,742,717,000 (2.5%)"
"June 30, 2014  6:30PM",graphicguy," imid...i heard about the car show just today.  missed it.  as always, i'm a day late and a dollar short."
"June 30, 2014  6:54PM",jayrider, gas pricing conspiracy?  how about those blackjack dealers hitting 21 with 4 cards to beat my 20 off the deal.
"June 30, 2014  7:05PM",oldfarmer50," stick, i forget exactly where you are, somewhere in ohio? but here's one for you."
"June 30, 2014  7:26PM",graphicguy, jay.....you'll get no sympathy from me.  i was at a table where the dealer hit 3 blackjacks out of 5 deals while the wife and i were cruising.  -1
"June 30, 2014  7:43PM",stickguy," farmer, i'm in south jersey. just outside philly. not sure what i would do with a parts car, but it us in my price range!"
"June 30, 2014  8:23PM",oldfarmer50," sorry about that, the old brain gets things confused these days.  i think it's because my wife always moves my stuff and tells me i just forgot where i put it. parts car?  you could sit in it and go vroom vroom.  think of what you'd save on insurance too.here's one near you that runs and nowhere near 250k miles."
"June 30, 2014  8:55PM",stickguy, that one reads almost exactly like my 2000 acura tl.
"June 30, 2014  9:23PM",fezo, now here i went all the way to kentucky to meet one of the gang and stick's just across the state from me (and a small state at that) but no..... i'm still taking nominations on upgrades for the mazda.  i figure real performance tires once the current ones wear out.  probably know what i'm getting there.  there are troublemakers in here i tell you....
"June 30, 2014  9:26PM",stever," i'd think the best upgrade for you would be a new head unit, amp or an xm/sirius subscription."
"June 30, 2014  9:29PM",oldfarmer50," ""i'm still taking nominations on upgrades for the mazda. i figure real performance tires once the current ones wear out."" throw a turbo on it and hang on!"
"June 30, 2014  9:36PM",Mr_Shiftright," oh i see what i did--it should be ""usa is world's largest exporter of oil""  (that is, all oil products---saudi arabia and ussr still lead in basic crude oil).  our export numbers include  natural gas liquids and biofuels."
"June 30, 2014  9:57PM",fezo, i'll bet a turbo is out of my price range....
"June 30, 2014 10:01PM",stickguy," not even sure there is a turbo kit for the mazda v6.  or the 3.0l even needs it (assuming you want traction at the front wheels). around here, with the traffic, lights and cops, that car is already overpowered.  much better use of money making it fun to drive. and fezo, you are much closer to qbrozen.  but next time you are down this way, feel free to stop in!  i am actually about 15 minutes from where tjc lives (wonder how he is doing, and if jr. arrived yet?) so can have a big meet up!"
"June 30, 2014 10:18PM",fezo," i used to work on qbrozen but to no avail.  probably because i always had something mechanical for him to do.  heck, he and i are in the same county, along with 600,000 other people."
"July  1, 2014 12:12AM",snakeweasel," ok i made a few phone calls with it, played music with it's external speakers for most of the day and did a lot of web surfing and still had over 40% power. fwiw at the time i would have had to plug in the iphone i still had over 70% power (but note that the iphone was 4 or 5 years old and the battery was dying a slow death). overall i am pleased with the battery life."
"July  1, 2014 12:25AM",snakeweasel," that's what you get when your dealer is jimmy ""cards"" molinari."
"July  1, 2014 12:27AM",snakeweasel, your wife does that too?
"July  1, 2014 12:56AM",jayrider, if molinari is a sicilian that explains a lot. my ancestors are from the north--- we are piedmontese --- near the french border.  must be some kind of vendetta.

"July  1, 2014  1:34AM",houdini1, jack it up and drive a new one under it !!

"July  1, 2014  2:42AM",berri, it's sad that people hear italian and presume it's all about pasta and tomato sauce. northern italian food is great - what german should be
"July  1, 2014  9:55AM",oldfarmer50, 8 million more gm car recalled? is there any car they made in the last 15 years not effected? gm's ytd sales are down 8.5% which means nothing since ford is down 6.3%.
"July  1, 2014 11:33AM",jayrider, my 2012 buick is still clear. for now.  i pick my car like i pick slot machines. always a winner.
"July  1, 2014 12:20PM",bwia," jay, is there a published list of recalled buick? i own a 2011 buick cxs and last week i got dic reading to service suspension. i took it to the dealer who diagnosed it as a faulty sensor. one week later the sensor has not arrived and i am beginning to wonder if this is a widespread problem."
"July  1, 2014  1:15PM",oldfarmer50, ha ha! i love that! they haven't recalled #1 son's 98 buick or son#2's 93 caddy or my 88 vandura so i guess we're winners too. i wouldn't press my luck in a casino though.
"July  1, 2014  1:33PM",oldfarmer50, correction gm sales were not down 8.5%.  that was an edmunds estimate. actual sales were up about 1%.
"July  1, 2014  1:35PM",ray80," not jay but if your interested in any outstanding recalls for your gm vehicle this should help, just need the vin"
"July  1, 2014  2:17PM",fezo," yes, and  nothing like italian food....  good, though."
"July  1, 2014  2:30PM",stever, it's part of gm's new marketing plan to get more people into their dealerships. and it's .
"July  1, 2014  2:32PM",graphicguy," my father came over on the boat and was originally raised in a little town just south of rome.  my mother's family (her parents came over on the boat) was from northern italy.  two very different types of italians. it's kind of like talking to someone from alabama, while eating at a southern family restsaturnnt compared to talking to  a native new yorker while eating at a haute cuisine restsaturnnt in manhattan. both as american as can be....both quite different. was it posted here, or somewhere else?  i read a quote/study/blurb that every other country is trying harder and harder to become more and more like the u.s.a....from food, to culture, to trends, etc. not sure if that's a good or a bad thing.  i vote it's good!"
"July  1, 2014  2:52PM",graphicguy," older sister, jag fan, is looking for a new car.  she has an ""s"" type, with 140k miles on it.  but, they don't make the ""s"" any more and she feels the xf and the xj don't fill the bill. so, she's looking at other lux car.  of course, she calls her little brother for an opinion (i've got plenty of those). her budget is $60k, less is better. i recommended she drive a mercedes-benz benz e350, bmw 5 series, audi audi, and acura acura.  this test driving has been going on for about month. first up was the e350 4matic.  surprisingly, she didn't like it.  she said it felt too ""ponderous"".  not sure what that means, but it is a bigger car than her old ""s-type"".  she says it didn't even have leather for that price (yeah....i don't get that, either).  she was underwhelmed. next up, she drove a bmwx.....she liked it.  but, she has the mental block of paying that kind of money for a car with a 4 cyl (regardless of how good it might be).  i told her for her budget, she could get a bmwx.  we'll see if she jumps on one. the audi audi she liked.  but, after hearing of my go round with the s4, it's not going to make her short list.  btw, i read a pro review of the audi s7 last week.  the publication complained about one of the things i had an issue with regarding my s4....the audi system binding.  sounds like audi has an engineering problem on their hands.  at least in my case, one they can not fix. that brings up the acura acura.  she has tastes similar to mine, so i thought she'd like it.  she did.....a lot. so, it's now down to the bmw 5 series and the acura acura.  i know i can get a 5 right around $6k off.  the acura was running $10k off msrp about a month ago.  but, it looks like acura trunk money might be gone as that deal is tougher to find right now around here.  they're running about $4k off now."
"July  1, 2014  3:03PM",driver100," i'm back.  haven't had time to go through 400 posts since i have been gone.  saw lots of car in england, that look like buick.  looked up the name insignia and found they are vauxhall insignias, and are buick buick in china and north america another car that surprised me was a low slung mercedes-benz benz c550 estate wagon.  we don't get those in north america, but i saw quite a few in england."
"July  1, 2014  3:31PM",stickguy, now that is a wagon that hauls!
"July  1, 2014  3:45PM",abacomike,
"July  1, 2014  3:59PM",houdini1, i think i would have also recommended the 2015 genesis.
"July  1, 2014  4:25PM",bwia," i am surprised she is not looking at an suv or a cuv. these crossovers are exceedingly popular with women for the high riding position and easy ingress and exit. the range rover evoque or some other luxury brand of that ilk may worth a look, if she is so inclined."
"July  1, 2014  4:29PM",bwia," thanks for that jay (oops i mean ray,) i will look it up as soon as i find my vin."
"July  1, 2014  4:37PM",driver100," i have a feeling ggs sister won't be interested in a genesis.  the genesis would appeal to a very value conscious buyer who doesn't care what the rest of the world thinks. i wonder why ggs sis needs a larger car like an audi, 528 or e class.  the 528 is not a real car lovers car...if you are getting a 5 series you have to go 535 with an m package - so you can get the sport suspension when you want it. i think she should consider a smaller c class, 335, or audi all loaded up and get something that will be more fun.  maybe even an audi or bmw 4 series 2 door coupe.  that's just my opinion."
"July  1, 2014  4:42PM",Mr_Shiftright, i think the 2015 mercedes-benz benz c class is going to be a really nice car for the money. not out until fall however.
"July  1, 2014  5:06PM",laurasdada," actually, that is a jag xf shooting brake, not a mb.  i'd buy one in a heartbeat over an suv..."
"July  1, 2014  5:10PM",laurasdada," has she been to the jag dealer?  what about the xf (or xj) doesn't float her boat?  too modern for a jag, style-wise?  outside the box thinkers want to know.  although, if i was truly an outside the box thinker, one would think i could come up with a less trite phrase than outside the box..."
"July  1, 2014  5:13PM",Mr_Shiftright, i'd be careful with jaguar--they might not be in the us market in the coming years.
"July  1, 2014  5:16PM",laurasdada," i'm just going to ignore that...as i do all potential depressing news.  like my retirement account statements, results from my annual physical and any correspondences from the irs.  it's a good life."
"July  1, 2014  5:17PM",Mr_Shiftright, it's not jaguar/range rover car that i'm worried about--they're doing pretty well--it's the parent company tata that is cause for concern.  jaguar is doing very well in china.
"July  1, 2014  5:26PM",laurasdada," jaguar  i like the car so much, that i bought the company! such rumors abounded about audi, too, not too long ago... i'm not sure i'm understanding your concern about tata, are they in financial trouble?"
"July  1, 2014  5:36PM",Mr_Shiftright," well their ceo apparently ?? committed suicide this past january by taking a flying off a hotel,  amid depressing sales results as the article says at the end, jaguar is the only good news for the company so far."
"July  1, 2014  5:42PM",laurasdada," well, while certainly not an uplifting story, i'm not sure i'd yet panic about jlr pulling out of the us in the near future. gg  take your sis to the jag dealer.  see if they have a buy one get one sale going.  if so, if she buys an xf, i'll give y'all a few $ for the f-type they throw in..."
"July  1, 2014  5:52PM",fushigi, it may be due to the carrier &amp; not the phone.  on modern smartphones some carriers configure them to aggressively seek out wifi hotspots so the carrier can lessen the use of their cellular data network.  they're managing their network at the expense of your battery life/user experience.  example sprint used to call it connection manager but may be calling it smart mode now.  on my s4 it's in settings under wi-fi.  disabling that meant my end-of-day battery was at least 30% higher.
"July  1, 2014  6:28PM",ab348," speaking of such things, i was behind a white equus in traffic yesterday. surprised me, first one i have seen here. didn't know they were even selling them locally - maybe one got on the car carrier by accident with a shipment of accents. from the rear at least, it is totally unimpressive-looking and very generic. this one was in livery service, maybe that's its niche now that ford is no longer making lincoln."
"July  1, 2014  6:30PM",ab348, my 2012 buick is still clear. for now. i pick my car like i pick slot machines. always a winner. my 2011 buick has not come up on the list yet either. recall-free!
"July  1, 2014  6:44PM",driver100," actually, i had a hard time finding a picture of the car i saw.  now, i think i have it, a 2014 mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz shooting brake. another picture...they look quite ddodgeatic in real life. btw, that jag estate wagon looked pretty nice too."
"July  1, 2014  6:45PM",driver100, he can always get his car serviced at a dealer in china.
"July  1, 2014  7:11PM",bwia," hmmn, interesting, and thanks for sharing that information. my carrier is at&amp;t and they hit me with a $244 international data charge for only 102 mb of data usage. that's how they make up for their unlimited phone and text messages."
"July  1, 2014  7:21PM",robr2, well it's a bit of a stretch to say his suicide had anything to do with poor sales.  the poor economy created a difficult environment to sell car - even the nano. jaguar and land rover aren't going anywhere.  tata is a huge conglomerate.  tata motors is just 1 of over 100 subsidiaries that the tata group has and jaguar and land rover are important brands to them.
"July  1, 2014  7:28PM",fezo," enough of that.  what am i going to do with my mazda 6?  looking for things like shocks and springs.  the performance tires will come as the current ones, which are perfectly nice, wear down a bit."
"July  1, 2014  7:42PM",stickguy," i linked to a nice suspension set up the other day.  springs struts shock tower brace and tires, and ready to auto-x.  senior division."
"July  1, 2014  7:50PM",oldfarmer50, don't forget to get some cool wheels to go with the suspension upgrades.
"July  1, 2014  8:36PM",abacomike,
"July  1, 2014  8:46PM",fezo, farmer - i have enough eye trouble without adding that to it! stick - don't suppose you could repost that link?  i'll find it otherwise.
"July  1, 2014  8:48PM",fezo, never mind. found it.
"July  1, 2014  8:49PM",driver100," i thought about that when i saw it...i said, that's just like mikes only as a wagon! they look pretty awesome in real life.....but, of course it doesn't make much of a wagon, with that low roof and sloped rear end.  it says, i am a practical person who drives a very utilitarian station wagon.........but, it doesn't mean it has to be a dull old station style wagon."
"July  1, 2014  9:22PM",fezo," this is all stick's fault - but, dear, they were on sale....."
"July  1, 2014 10:00PM",imidazol97," they look like an interesting theory for strut/shock adaptation. but, i would think there needs to be some electronic active control. i just can't see a passive system actually working."
"July  1, 2014 10:03PM",explorerx4," i was glad to see the 97-04 chevrolet finally made the recall list, not because i wanted it to, but because it needed to be on that list. my mother had to replace the ignition in her '03. her problem was a no start condition and it was due to a 'heavy' key chain, hondaing to the dealer. there were a lot of keys on the key chain, but no more than were on it when she had her lebaron for almost 10 years. got my fusion back after 2 weeks at the dealer, so i'm out of car shopping mode for now."
"July  1, 2014 10:07PM",isellhondas, i can see a person buying one jaguar but to want another? maybe gg's sister lucked out and found an exceptional one.
"July  1, 2014 10:07PM",houdini1, that is one big ugly car !
"July  1, 2014 11:12PM",oldfarmer50, that's a pretty cool wagon but i can't help think mb lifted the idea from the dodge dodge during the chrysler days.
"July  1, 2014 11:16PM",oldfarmer50," t, dear, they were on sale..... that sounds intriguing.  i'd like to see the results of that installation."
"July  1, 2014 11:29PM",oldfarmer50, i would think they would recall that generation chevrolet and corporate twin olds cutlass because of the design defect that caused gaping rust holes around the fuel door.  almost bought one of those and am glad i didn't.
"July  1, 2014 11:54PM",ab348," whatever that design was, it wasn't just limited to those models. my olds intrigue had a similar problem and i often see chevrolets, aleros and many other gm car of that era with rust there. i know on my intrigue you could not get at the area from under the car to apply rustproofing. i was apparently an unsealed double-panel area of some sort that let water and road salt get into the area."
"July  1, 2014 11:56PM",fezo, i'm checking the mazda dealer for oem springs.  if they don't have them i'll live.
"July  2, 2014 12:09AM",explorerx4," fezo, check rock auto. i got the rear lift gate struts for my ford delivered under $50 for the pair. dealer price was around $80 each. they were an exact replacement (same manufacturer)."
"July  2, 2014  1:03AM",henryn, rock auto is good.  sometimes amazon is even better if you have amazon prime and get free 2 day delivery.
"July  2, 2014  1:11AM",roadburner," it does- at least in my experience with fsds on the ms3. quite well, in fact."
"July  2, 2014  1:33AM",stickguy," fezo, my wife is always yelling at me about something, so i won't even notice yours doing it too.  so feel free to point the bus my way! don't forget the strut tower brace."
"July  2, 2014  1:55AM",driver100, that's a pretty cool wagon but i can't help think mb lifted the idea from the dodge dodge during the chrysler days. you have to be joking this compares to this; it's like saying a a lada niva started the suv craze
"July  2, 2014  4:54AM",roadburner, i wouldn't mind a 2008 dodge srt8 for a chrysler. the '08 facelift was a huge improvement
"July  2, 2014 10:36AM",oldfarmer50," i didn't say they didn't make a prettier car, just that the concept of the swoop-back wagon was created by chrysler.  just like the pt chrysler started the crossover trend. the suv craze was started by jeep and land rover. like or not chrysler came up with some pretty good ideas that were built upon by others.  think minivans."
"July  2, 2014 11:56AM",driver100," also k - car which were big sellers at the time.  one big mistake was the 1934 chrysler airflow...designed on airplane engineering.  a great car technically, ahead of the others, just that people thought it looked peculiar."
"July  2, 2014 12:12PM",houdini1," my family had a ""jeepster"" back in the early 1950's. can't remember if it had 2 or 4 doors, but it was a hard top. my mom learned to drive in it."
"July  2, 2014 12:19PM",ab348," i would suggest it was started by amc in the '70s with the hornet sportabout. while there is no denying jeep was an early suv pioneer, the vehicle that normalized suvs for the american public was the original ford ford."
"July  2, 2014 12:53PM",stever," i remember getting excited about the concept caravan back in my tennessee days, late 70s, early 80s. probably because the previous minivan that had been in the family had a big bump in the rear over the motor, which hampered the usability. that was a 1969 volkswagen bus, complete with an otherwise flat floor and a sliding door."
"July  2, 2014  1:40PM",oldfarmer50," amc hornet sportabout ""while there is no denying jeep was an early suv pioneer, the vehicle that normalized suvs for the american public was the original ford ford."" how about the bronco?"
"July  2, 2014  1:54PM",graphicguy," ld....mr shiftright and all the rest of you miscreants (as he types sarcastically)....not sure what my sister didn't like about the new jags.  personally, i think they're a whole ton better looking and performing than her ""s"".  plus, she likes the brand.  it may be her dealer (she lives in indianapolis).  i told her the dealer in cincy has a good rep.  buy it here, service it there. anyway, she finally test drove the bmwx and the acura last night.  she likes both.  apparently, there is that much of a difference between how the bmw drives vs the bmw.  not really a surprise. that twin scroll turbo 3.0 6 cal is a gem. but, the  ""gotcha"" is the price.....well into the $60s the way she wants it cooked up. she really liked the acura, too.  my guess, that's how she's leaning. regarding the mercedes-benz benz e350, not sure what the issue was.  i know she was put off by the fact that for the kind of money they're asking, she didn't even get leather interior.  plus, bmw wooed her with the free 4 year maintenance and wear/tear coverage.  it's an extra charge (which isn't a small charge) for the mercedes-benz benz. we'll see how this plays out.  her phone calls are coming fast and furious trying to get her to buy now.  when is the june sales month finished?"
"July  2, 2014  3:28PM",ab348," no. when i say normalized i mean having soccer moms drive them to school to pick up the kids or to go shopping in, that sort of thing. the bronco never did that in any of its forms. the way the ford took off in the early '90s among mainstream buyers really set off the suv craze."
"July  2, 2014  4:39PM",laurasdada," good luck to sis, i'm sure she'll make the right choice.  i still like the ""hondausivity"" of the xf (read  for every 10,000 e, 5, audi sold, one xf is sold!). i'm sure the acura is a nice ride.  but, man, that exterior, imho, is just as dull as dishwater!  my '05 tl was such a handsome design, hope acura can find that magic again..."
"July  2, 2014  4:39PM",bwia," is obama really that bad? a quinnipiac university poll found him to be the worst president since wwii. at this rate he won't be on mount rushmore anytime soon. this thread is not meant to be political but presidential politics affect issues dear to our hearts, to wit jobs, healthcare, automobiles and petrol. obama is unfortunate to be presiding over a changing world order and america is not the sphere of influence it used to be. let's face it folks the geopolitical challenges of our times make us look weak. no president can change that momentum shift, not even .....(fill in the blank with your favorite president.) from all accounts i have read and seen this buick belongs to china and to a lesser extent brazil. china needs raw materials on unprecedented scale and brazil is willing and able to satisfy their insatiable need."

"July  3, 2014  3:48PM",mako1a," oldfarmer, i've been waiting to hear what other posters had to say about your possible ford purchase. since i ordered the first 2013 v6 and traded for the gt off the lot i'm somewhat familiar with option packages. (ford is pitiful with options). first off, since you don't seem to listen to my advice i say go for the brembo brake package. you'll need it for all the 150 mph to zero stops you'll be doing and the regular brakes only work well at 90 or so. don't get a backup camera because the view out the slanted rear window is great as long as it's over 4 feet tall. the 3.55 posi rear which i have on both ford may not be important to you what with the rear end being so easy to control in rain, etc. don't bother with the recaro seat, they're just too comfy. and by all means, get the 4 cyl turbo so that when the turbo quits working you still have 92 hp to get you home. don't pay attention to any of this as i don't know much about ford. j/k of course."

"July  3, 2014  4:16PM",graphicguy," boy this steams me.... texas alone now outproduces iraqi oil output.  for all intents and purposes, the u.s. controls the oil we use, and produce, for the entier country.  big oil's recent excuse, that china has driven up the cost of gas in the u.s. (which always seemed particularly bogus to me), is now debunked.  we don't need to pay those prices.  we produce our own. oh...btw....know what a gallon of gas costs in iraq?  the country we liberated? try about $1.50/gal. another letter/phone call to boehner, the white house, etc."

"July  3, 2014  4:36PM",Mr_Shiftright," it's quite interesting that some of the most oil-rich countries have the most poverty and the most corruption.  you'd think such riches would be a boon to the population, but alas, that rarely happens."
"July  3, 2014  4:49PM",robr2," what the article fails to mention is that the methods needed for harvesting the ""tight oil"" requires fracking methods that are more expensive that traditional methods.  profitably drilling for ""tight oil"" can only be supported at higher oil prices.  if prices drop, those methods will be abandoned. i still get a little chuckle that people think there a correlation between oil production/prices and the price of gas.  the price of gas at the wholesale level is definitely controlled by the refiners.  since we don't have a real alternative to gasoline, the refiners are able to set prices where they want them.  the only way gas prices will drop ddodgeatically is if the profit motive were eliminated and i highly doubt anyone would want to see oil nationalized, as for the price of gas in iraq, it doesn't matter.  they don't export gas - they export oil.  besides, just because the us ""liberated"" iraq, we are not entitled to their oil.  remember, that little skirmish wasn't about oil. hands out for a slapping for crossing the political line....."

"July  4, 2014  2:29AM",thebean," i have a couple of questions regarding buying a car, if i may.  i didn't want to start a new thread for simple questions, so hopefully this one will be ok.  first of all, do you have any hesitation in buying a 3-4 year old used car if said car was a lease return?  i do, because it seems to me that people i know who lease car do not take very good care of them, especially maintenance.  i don't want engine/transmission trouble down the line, as i keep my car for a long time.  i have always bought new, but that does have a price.  i would like to consider a clean 3-4 year old used car.  there are so many lease returns on the used market today, but i don't want to be ""penny wise and pound foolish"". second question is regarding turbo-charged engines.  i'm in my 60's, and a sizable number of people i have known over the years have had issues with turbos, especially after the warranty has run out.  i have never owned a turbo-engined car for just this reason.  but, there are more and more turbos coming out in the interest of gas mileage.  am i being silly not considering a turbo?  i guess i could get the extended warranty if i do get a turbo, but i really hate to have maintenance issues/hassles. do you all have thoughts on these questions?  thanks in advance for any answers. larry c"
"July  4, 2014  2:40AM",houdini1," thanks again mike. yes, that's the type of awkwardness i was talking about between the regular divisions and the luxury divisions. i would think there would be more examples like the one you mentioned between nissan and infiniti. how about toyota and lexus? any stories?"

"July  4, 2014  2:59AM",dino001," does anybody have an opinion why volkswagen's sales are plunging?  seems audi is doing fine, but volkswagen is in the toilet.  my thesis is that toyota clone without toyota's reliability finally caught up with them.  they have always been below average with reliability, but driving experience, edgy styling and features were offsetting it.  they had a niche, but the fans were quite fanatic.  then they decided on cutting price with features (e.g. suspension, brakes on base versions are different than on upper trims) to raise sales.  the styling also went generic. worked initially, but now it seems you simply cannot outtoyota toyota.  others tried it before and failed as well.  seems volkswagen had to find it out on their own."
"July  4, 2014  3:24AM",abacomike,
"July  4, 2014  3:31AM",Mr_Shiftright," my opinion is that volkswagen doesn't really understand the us market. they need more models, faster turn-around and faster innovation. they just don't understand their competition."
"July  4, 2014  3:35AM",isellhondas, i suppose some people who lease car skimp on maintenance but i think that most people are pretty good about oil changes etc.  i know i wouldn't be afraid myself. i'm not a big fan of turbos.  i'm sure they have improved but why have one when modern four cylinder engines can be more than adequate.
"July  4, 2014  3:36AM",mako1a," thebean, i can offer only one opinion. others here may disagree. i too am skeptical of turbos. they run at very high speeds and require the best in lubrication and maintenance which may not always happen with a rental/lease vehicle. i had a friend with a 79 ford 4 cyl turbo who had his turbo get fried just past the warranty and he was extra careful with maintenance. that was 79 and this is 2014, but i still don't like the idea of a turbo. naturally aspirated and free flow exhaust only for me.  dave"
"July  4, 2014  3:56AM",roadburner," i have owned three turbocharged car(1984 thunderbird turbo coupe, 1991 volvo 744t, 2007 mazdapeed 3) and i have only replaced one turbo. some early mazdapeed turbos would smoke at idle and my car was one such example. it was replaced under warranty at 26kmiles. the replacement has been on the car for over 113k miles with no issues whatsoever. as for lease returns? i have yet to have a bad experience. depreciation is my friend; i've purchased several off-lease cpo bmw for the price of a new mid-range ford or toyota. no regrets."
"July  4, 2014 11:15AM",driver100," short answer.  i took as good care for my leased car as my owned ones.  i kept them in good shape because i may want to buy it back at the end of the lease.  also, the company i worked for paid for any maintenance or repairs, so sometimes work got done better than if it was privately owned.  i wouldn't hesitate to buy a leased used car, from a reputable dealer. also, i think if you take some care and pride in your car, it doesn't matter if it is owned or leased. i love turbo engines.  one of the great things to enjoy in driving today is the added boost of power a turbo gives....and i think it adds to your safety, for example coming onto a freeway. there is some risk, as turbos work hard, but, i personally would risk it.  i think i would seriously want at least a 2 year extended warranty on most used car.....one electronic repair can cost $1000s, turbo or not."
"July  4, 2014 12:15PM",snakeweasel," i would say you are better off with the 3-4 year lease than one that was a one or two year lease. the ones i knew that didn't take very good care of their car were the ones that knew they were not going to have them very long. that being said there is not much maintenance required for a car in that first 48k miles other than oil changes and some inspections. as for the turbos, if you are light footed and only need the extra power that the turbo provides once in a great while then go for it. if your driving style or power needs from the engine require a lot of work from the turbo forget it. my understanding is that the turbo needs time between bursts to cool down and if you are engaging the turbo at each stop light you will burn it out. many 4 cylinder car now have more than adequate power for most any real world driving. the wife's sonata has more than enough power for merging or passing. so unless you want high performance i would stay away from turbos."
"July  4, 2014 12:25PM",oldfarmer50, yes and no. i first saw the tricolor yellow in a ford magazine a ford nut at work slipped me and it looked nice then i saw that color on the ford site and it looked more mustard color so i guess i'll have to see it in person.  there's always my fall-back color--dark red.
"July  4, 2014 12:30PM",oldfarmer50," might do that even though i hate to be a ""stroke"" who wastes a salespersons time months before i plan to buy."
"July  4, 2014 12:33PM",abacomike,
"July  4, 2014 12:55PM",oldfarmer50, thebean echoes my exact concerns about buying off lease car. i would think the first thing to do is ask for service records to assure yourself that the previous owner at least did basic maintenance.  there's always the fear in the back of your mind that he beat it like a rental car for three years.  but that's true of any car. as to turbos i'm sure they build them better these days but why risk have an expensive part blow up when a non-turbo can do the job.
"July  4, 2014  2:07PM",oldfarmer50," excellent advice mike. ""if you are buying a turbo, have your own mechanic check it over and drive it. he would be the one to notice undue hesitation and/or wear. today, many car have turbos - just be careful and make sure you buy an extended warranty."" i would recommend that a mechanic check out any  3 year old car, not just turbos.  after all you could be spending $15, $20k or more depending on the brand so it's essential.  i like the extended warranty idea too.  what's $1000 now to save many thousands later. way back in 87 i bought an off lease 84 chevrolet.  had my mechanic check it out and found several oil leaks which were repaired by the dealer as part of the negotiation.  turned down the extended warranty which was $300 iirc. about a week after the 30 day warranty expired it blew the ac compressor (like all gms) and cost me the same $300.  hate to think what i would have done with a turbo that blew."
"July  4, 2014  2:26PM",imidazol97," it blew the ac compressor (like all gms) i have never, never had an ac compressor fail on my gm car. never. if you had seen the compressors from all the other companies taken apart and laid out side-by-side, you would wonder how the others even make it off the dealership lots before dying. in fact, for a time some other companies were using gm's compressors."
"July  4, 2014  2:48PM",roadburner," i've owned(and will own) only one gm car, and the ac compressor  never had an issue. ditto for the three chevrolets my father owned."
"July  4, 2014  2:59PM",roadburner, happy 4th of july!!!
"July  4, 2014  3:16PM",abacomike," yes, imid, gm ac compressors have been used in many makes and models of car throughout the years.  at one time, mercedes-benz benz used only ""fridgidaire"" compressors (1992-1999).  that was as a result of horrible compressors being used in their car.  i had 4 or 5 mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz car during the 80's and 90's, and all of them took for ever to cool the car down.  arguably, i lived in the california desert area for most of the 90's, and most compressors struggle in that kind of heat in the summertime.  but in the mercedes-benz benz, it was awful.  now, the air-conditioning in their car is outstanding.  even better than bmw - from my experiences with both brands."
"July  4, 2014  3:22PM",abacomike," <strong>  rolls royce wraith sold on the third day </strong> that rolls royce wraith i posted about last week (brown/beige two-tone) sold on the third day it was wheeled into the boca town center mall, hondaing to the sales rep who replaced it with a white wraith this morning.  it sold for msrp (of course).  he said the wraith is new for 2014, and built on the ghost platform.  660 hp out of a 12 cylinder twin turbo engine.  even with the wraith weighing in at about 5000+ pounds, 660 hp should move that rascal around quite well, i would think. the dealer (rolls/bentley of palm beach) also shows up with phantoms every so often.  that phantom is so wide and long, it would never fit well into my parking space.  so i guess i'll pass on buying one for that very reason!!!"

"July  4, 2014  3:32PM",henryn," just my opinion, but i don't think anyone who is satisfied with ""adequate"" would be a possible candidate for a car with a turbocharged engine. i have owned two car that came equipped with turbocharged 4 cylinder engines, a 1985 dodge and a 2008 volkswagen (still own that one).  i have had no negative experiences with the engines, but i bought both of them new and took very good care of them - frequent oil changes, always used synthetic oil, etc. i would be somewhat hesitant to buy a used car with a turbo.  i would want to know that it was adult owned, and properly maintained.  (i would buy a used turbo from myself, in other words! (smile) ) i would be leary of buying any high performance car used.  something with a big torquey v-8 (ford gt, chevrolet ss) would worry me a good deal less than a high revving turbocharged 4 cylinder. leaving aside the turbo question, if i were in your position i would much prefer an off-lease car to a rental unit.  i think the rental car are the ones that get abused horrifically. that was never really true.  what was true, many years ago before the widespread use of synthetic oil, was that you needed to allow the turbo time to cool down before stopping the engine.  these days, just use a high quality synthetic oil, and it is not a problem."
"July  4, 2014  3:37PM",roadburner," i remember brock yates writing that in less than 25 years mercedes-benz benz was transformed from a brand that was sold at studebaker dealers and beloved of eccentric college professors into one of the most respected/aspirational automobiles in the us and the world. blw followed a similar trajectory from 1955 to 1980, leaving behind the baroque angels and isettas and becoming the marque that was known for building iconic sports coupes and sedan. of course munich is now squandering that brand image by trying to be all things to all people, but i digress..."
"July  4, 2014  3:46PM",stickguy," sons volkswagen has a turbo.  i doubt any normal driver could tell as it is transparent. but quite quick, and an easy 37-38 highway,  good around town, all out of 1.8l on rug."
"July  4, 2014  4:22PM",oldfarmer50," that's interesting.  i've had nothing but bad luck. the aforementioned chevrolet, 82 olds, 91 olds, 84 chevrolet and just recently my son's 98 buick.  the only one still plugging along is the other son's 93 caddy.  i've had ford and chrysler stop cooling but a can of 134 made them work again. the gms all blew compressors. maybe i just have a gm jinx."
"July  4, 2014  4:22PM",robr2," i have a 2005 volkswagen 1.8t with 115k miles and not one turbo issue. it it under powered with the ac on around town but once the turbo hits and get it into the power band, it does fine.  30 mpg on the highway with premium. stickguy - tell your son to use premium as recommended - using regular in the 1.8t is a false economy."
"July  4, 2014  5:02PM",Mr_Shiftright," turbos are the ""substitute for cubic inches"" that you keep hearing about that have no substitute so yeah, a 1.6 or 1.8l engine pushing 3,000+ pounds needs a turbo, but a 2 or 3 liter engine probably doesn't.  it's really up to you to decide if the car you are considering really has the ""grunt"" (torque) to get you away nicely on freeway dodgeps and up long steep inclines. nobody wants to be stuck in an underpowered car with passengers screaming up a hill in 3rd gear. modern turbos are efficient and long-lived, and aren't really all that expensive to replace at the end of their service life. so if you need a dinky car engine to go faster, or you need a high performance car to go scary-fast, or you have a diesel-powered car or truck, then you need a turbo; otherwise, i don't see why you do."
"July  4, 2014  5:26PM",henryn," everything in life is a trade off, isn't it?  back in 2008, i could get a volkswagen with a 4 cylinder and turbo, or a toyota with the v6.  both were fast, and fun to drive.  but the volkswagen was more fun, and about the same money, so ... if i had bought the toyota, it would have cost a bit less for routine maintenance over the 103k miles i have owned the car, and it would have a higher resale value now.  but the difference is not that much, and i have enjoyed the volkswagen.  so like the man said,"
"July  4, 2014  5:59PM",abacomike," <strong>  speaking of hurricanes </strong> i was pretty amazed that a small, insignificant low pressure area off the coast of st.augustine, fl, could develop in just 3 days from a ""nothing"" into a hurricane.  usually these storms organize in the gulf of mexico this time of year and later in the hurricane season, off the coast of africa as they travel across the mid atlantic toward the east and west indies. it's very ominous for a category 2 hurricane to form so close to the mainland u.s.  i understand that the gulf stream influenced this fast organization.  i thought the el nino in the southeast pacific was going to inhibit hurricane development this year.  guess the meteorologists got that one wrong."
"July  4, 2014  6:04PM",abacomike," <strong>  ...and while we're on the subject of turbos </strong> i honestly don't understand why mercedes-benz benz put twin turbos in the base cls 550.  i can understand it in the amg models, but why the base cls 550?  a 4.7 litre v8 should have more than enough torque and hp without the use of turbos.  accelerating from 35 mph on the highway to 70 mph can give you whiplash in my car.  without twin turbos, how much ""thrust"" would i lose?"
"July  4, 2014  6:32PM",roadburner," in my opinion, horsepower is like some other things(that i won't mention on a family-oriented forum) <strong>  some </strong> is good. <strong>  more </strong> is better. <strong>  too much </strong> is just enough..."
"July  4, 2014  6:55PM",ab348," we were? it's pretty normal i think. not sure i would call it ominous. the hype up here has been unreal of course. the media really needs to throttle back the fear-mongering. this thing is now going to mostly miss us and bring a bit of wind tomorrow but that's about all. nevertheless they are telling people to fill their bathtubs, buy bottled water and canned food, etc. ridiculous. i imagine we will be playing volkswagen here around suppertime. the media has lost all sense of balance in reporting on weather. they could serve a valuable role by informing us of real threats when they happen. instead they overblow every little thing whether a threat or not, and as a result the public becomes desensitized. that in turn makes fora real problem when a big threat appears and people just blow it off as another false alarm."

"July  4, 2014  7:47PM",Mr_Shiftright," man never satisfied....it's true what you say. of course, there is such a thing as too much power in a car with a poor chassis and brakes...i believe the term i'm groping for is ""death trap"". as you know from your time viewing others on the track-- ""if you are a lousy driver with 200hp, you're going to be really bad with 400hp"". i've had a lot of turbo and sc car--the only thing i don't like about <em>  some </em> turbos is peakiness---a big on/off switch.  nowadays, ""turbo lag"" is rather rare in a modern car."
"July  4, 2014  8:16PM",bwia," nowadays, ""turbo lag"" is rather rare in a modern car. we have a buick buick with a 138 hp, awd, 4 cylinder, 6 speed transmission with turbo. since i never had a turbo charged vehicle before i cannot tell the difference since the cuv takes 10+ seconds to 60."
"July  4, 2014  8:45PM",roadburner," a friend of mine was the bmw club's national driving event coordinator for years, and he always said that he wished that he could start every novice student out in a dead stock bmw 1600 with 165/80r13 michelin xas tires. students would learn about conserving momentum and threshold braking as well as experience how the friction circle principle works at a relatively low speed. today's car are equipped with such effective traction and stability control systems that they can convince a ham-handed driver that he/she actually knows what he/she is doing. despite the admonitions from a few hand-wringing bedwetters, rb jr.'s first car was a 1975 2002- dead stock save for bilstein hds, e21 recaros, and a weber 32/36 dgav. i told him that if he drove it for a year with no accidents or tickets i'd allow him to upgrade, and he did- to my wife's 2004 x3. he actually told me that he thought that if he got something fast he'd only get into trouble..."

"July  5, 2014  6:40PM",oldfarmer50, sure gives you the horsepower bragging rights but the dodge is so heavy that a lot of that power is wasted just getting it moving.  at 4200 pounds that's 600-700 pounds more than the ford. like the chevrolet i just can't love the styling.  while it's not a bad looking car there's just something that looks a little off about it. too bad because as an old chrysler fan i'd love it to be a winner.

"July  6, 2014  1:11AM",oldfarmer50, that's a nice red color.  did you wax it for her? wasn't the mazda tribute the same as the ford? the reason i ask is that my sister-in-law had a tribute and last year it suddenly accelerated in reverse and took the corner off a building totaling it.  she said it was a recall problem that she neglected to fix. i had never heard of either car having an ua problem and she suffers from ms so i always wondered if she hit the gas but didn't know it.

"July  6, 2014  8:22PM",driver100," fascinating sales story.  how a $2300 car becomes a $13k car.....it's like a magic trick. what i would keep in mind though, is; your mileage is going to be low so this car could easily last 10 or 20 years, which brings the yearly cost down to $1300 or maybe even $700 a year. you may trade the car in one day and you will recoup a lot of that initial payment, so the car will never cost you the full $13k. in 10 years that $70 a day to rent a car will be about $140 unless there is serious deflation. it is a perfect car for getting around in a holiday spot. we have friends who are going to rent a susuki 4 wheeler for 3 months in costa rica.......$1200 a month. they can get a high mileage old big american car for a lot less, but it could break down easily. remember, if you leave the car for over 6 to 8 months you may want to add stab-il to the gas tank and inflate the tires before you leave. it looks brand new.  enjoy!"

(based on piston displacement). so for a big american boat, it might cost 152% the value of the car plus the shipping, insurance, land transport,  etc.  so a $10,000 car might end costing you about $28.5k"
"July  7, 2014 12:09AM",dino001," this import story shows how good we have it here when it comes to car.  many countries charge king's ransom for those transactions in terms of taxes, which causes volumes to be much lower, which raises prices even higher.  double whammy.  so when new car cost double of tripple of prices here, then used market is also smaller, ie residuals are actually higher and that's how it still pays off to import something to those places, even if taxes and fees are quadruppling the starting price."

"July  7, 2014  1:50AM",driver100," to keep it simple, a car would cost you about 20% more to buy in canada, without the exchange calculated, because that varies.  that 20% is pretty close to the numbers you gave. the exchange rate varies, right now the u.s dollar is worth about $1.08, or almost another 10% difference. the volkswagen cost $23k in florida, here it would have cost $27 to $28k.  and, many car are built in canada still cost 20% more here.  some reason are less population so higher costs to ship, real estate is much higher (avg price of a home is about $360k), salaries are higher, taxes are higher, health costs, etc.  20% seems excessive to me, 10% would be more realistic. from what i can figure out, a car in england will cost about 160% of what a car would cost in the us.  mostly due to built in taxes...those taxes support a very, by us standards, liberal government, and a costly place to live. hope that is of some help.  i guess that is another reason you are fortunate to live in the us."

"July  7, 2014  4:39AM",sterlingdog," your post reminds me of a good friend who purchased a new bmw in 1970.  he bragged about the quality, performance, outstanding materials and workmanship, etc.  his was the only bmw in town and people just laughed and walked away.  i think that by now he is the one who has had the last laugh.  he recognized something that the rest of us didn't have a clue about in 1970. richard"

"July  7, 2014 11:59AM",driver100," &gt; i can't find anything on the nbc website to clarify what they said.  maybe, what they meant was.......every gm brand has been recalled, except for the 3 they said weren't recalled.  i believe there are 36 brands.  so, maybe not necessarily every car....but every brand name has been recalled over the last year.  just guessing, because they saiod it fast and it was a short story, but, i can't find anything to confirm what they said. good to hear from you....we were all getting worried about you.  your bil is fortunate to have such nice caring people watching over him.  hope it goes as well as possible."
"July  7, 2014 12:12PM",bwia, we first stumbled on st. lucia many years ago on a caribbean cruise. the island is beautiful and close to what hawaii looked like 30 years ago. what we like most is the warm days and cool nights (because of the constant trade winds) and the ability to go to nearby martinique for a cozy french lunch or dinner. the stagnant economy syndrome is a product of the world bank and imf. these impoverished and developing countries borrow heavily for infrastructural development and education and to repay these loans they tax the local citizenry at unconscionable rates.
"July  7, 2014 12:34PM",Michaell, richard - nyc is around; he's been posting lots of questions in various leasing discussions as he begins his search to replace the bmw that comes off lease at the end of september.
"July  7, 2014 12:34PM",stickguy," sorry to hear richard, but in this situation it is good you had time together, and with all the pain the end really is a relief, especially for him.  hospice is wonderful people. and nyc is around.  probably just busy out test driving since he needs a car this summer!  monroe wanders by occasionally."
"July  7, 2014  1:46PM",driver100," idid another search and found out what nbc did mean.  they actually meant that of the 36 major lines gm sells, every model has been recalled except for 3. so, not every car, just every line has been recalled except for 3, terrain, chevrolet and chevrolet. not sure why that would really get mentioned...it doesn't mean a lot really, but, does make the situation look worse."
"July  7, 2014  1:48PM",graphicguy," now that is something i can park in the gg grand auto estate! man, do i ever want to get behind the wheel of that car.  of course, that's going to be one of those car that the dealers won't let you test drive unless you give them some sort of deposit.  and, that's something i just won't do."
"July  7, 2014  1:55PM",graphicguy," ok...we were gone over the 4th so i must have missed bwia's purchase. so, help me understand.....you bought a ~$2,500 from japan to send to somewhere in the caribbean....for $13,000 due to taxes and fees? i'm ignorant of laws and regs of most island countries, but there isn't an easier, better, cheaper way to do that?  why buy it in japan?"
"July  7, 2014  1:57PM",driver100," we have florida friends who do something similar.  they live in florida all year and they find july, august and september get just too hot and humid.  so they rent a beautiful home in the mountains in costa rica for 3 months....about $1600 a month for a luxurious home, swimming pool, maid etc.  temperatures are in the 70s constantly, no need for heat or air conditioning.  they walk into town and get a beautiful meal for $4! we are planning on visiting one year.  i'd like to see some of the wildlife....nature kind,....those colorful frogs and birds! i don't know if most americans would want to live that way constantly, but, it could make a nice break from our hectic pace of life.  even a slow life.  i remember once the only numbers i needed to remember was my house and phone numbers.  now i have a few phone numbers (home, business, cell), various passwords and pin numbers, social insurance number, cell phone numbers for my wife and friends (don't know how to add them to memory),  100 years ago you just had to get up, plough your fields, come home, have dinner and go to sleep, today we make 100s of decisions every day....hmm, like now i am thinking what i will eat for lunch."
"July  7, 2014  2:38PM",sterlingdog, thanks for letting me know about nyccarguy.  glad that he is doing ok.  he's a fine young man. richard
"July  7, 2014  2:47PM",sterlingdog," thanks for checking on that news item.  though it is a tremendous amount of recalls, perhaps barr has the right idea.  if she recalls them all now, then maybe gm can start with a clean slate once the repairs are all completed.  with the lawsuits and repairs, gm will have to unload many, many big bucks.  i hope that they can survive, though i would have to vote against another bailout.  i do think that gm has some nice styling in several of their new models.  i also believe that they are capable of building good car.  they certainly did it for many decades. richard"

"July  7, 2014  4:49PM",driver100," it can cost $900 transportation cost to ship a car from detroit to dayton ohio.  $4000 for shipping from japan to st lucia doesn't seem so out of line.  also, if you take a car to florida and register it there that could cost a few $100.  you pay state tax based on the value, i think it is 5% so easily $1000.  at least there is no doc fee, but we are up to about $3000 in fees in the us to get a car too."

"July  7, 2014  6:13PM",nyccarguy," haven't heard from you on ""ccba"" in a while.  i worry about you.  glad to see you are still around."
"July  7, 2014  6:45PM",nyccarguy," the hunt for my next car (sales story here, punch over on ccba) is as wide and varied as the landscape and people who make up this great nation.  i'm in the process of trying to renovate my kitchen.  with me providing 85 - 90 % of the material, labor costs are going to run a lot higher than my wife and i anticipate.  once we receive our tax refund next year (for 2014) and save up some more money, then we should be good to go by next spring. so the plan is to lease something for my wife who does mostly around town driving.  i can safely lease her a car with 12k per year as opposed to the 20k plus i need and still keep the price reasonable. i will take her honda as my daily driver and use my prelude as often as i can on beautiful spring and summer days. i'll ""pretend"" i'm still making bmw payments.  when i make the new car payment, i'll put the balance of my ""bmw payment"" into my savings account. obviously if she needs the honda for any reason (shuttling all 3 kids somewhere), it is hers. redoing my kitchen and cutting down on my car payment also helps me in the long run.  as of yesterday, we've officially been connecticut residents for 4 years.  once i redo the kitchen &amp; show a lower debt to income ratio, i can apply to refinance my house for 25 years (maybe 20, but i won't push my luck).  i'll qualify for a lower mortgage rate (currently paying 5.125%).  i'll be able to stop throwing away money every month on pmi (mortgage insurance). so far, i've only test driven a 2014 volkswagen volkswagen tdi which i really liked.  i'm also going to give the honda honda ex awd as well as a civic ex sedan a test drive too.  if i go with the volkswagen or the civic, i'll have to buy snow shoes for it.  the honda is awd, so it sill get me through the winter without problem."
"July  7, 2014  7:04PM",stickguy," i forgot all about pmi.  damn, i hated the whole idea of it.  what a scam."
"July  7, 2014  7:06PM",stickguy," check out the mazda cx-5 too if looking at the honda.  much nicer to drive.  and the 6 vs. volkswagen, though the honda is very nice too.  civic, just to small, tinny and poor driving for family duty."
"July  7, 2014  7:21PM",abacomike,
"July  7, 2014  8:21PM",nyccarguy," pmi drives me absolutely bonkers.  when i bought my house 4 years ago, i only had 10% to put down.  so i have to pay pmi - 2% tacked on to the back end of my mortgage plus $230 every month. then they changed the rules.  rates plummeted significantly not too long after i closed (1%+ lower).  they only tacked 1% on to the back end of the mortgage, but then the monthly was over $500.  so even with a full 1% cheaper interest rate, my mortgage payment would have gone up. so i really hope i can redo my kitchen, then refinance next year with a ""traditional"" mortgage.  have a cheaper payment plus no pmi!"
"July  7, 2014  9:06PM",driver100, that actually sounds like a great promotional idea for a car dealer to use to promote new car.  $7 a day is probably not enough to cover real costs but $20 a day probably would.  say i needed a rental car for 5 days.  i see my local hyundai dealer and get a new sonata for 5 days or $100.  i might really like it or recommend it to someone....seems like a good way to advertise car and drum up business.
"July  7, 2014  9:16PM",driver100," today they drive buick maybe they have dementia ! tastes change but i kind of went the other way.  i didn't know what a bmw was in the 70s and i lusted for a buick back then.......but today i would say a buick is a fine car, but i really lust for a bmw or similar car. what one person likes at a particular point in time doesn't mean too much.  they may like the buick because it is more comfortable or performance and handling just aren't as important to them.  or they feel more secure and don't need a bmw to keep up with the neighbors.  or, maybe they are living on their retiremant savings and are trying to be more economical.  i don't think it means buick are better car necessarily."

"July  7, 2014 11:12PM",nyccarguy," i agree the mazda might be a better drive, but it is very hard to ignore the honda's 62% residual value &amp; cheapo money factor. a civic for my wife to drive 2 1/2 miles to &amp; from work either by herself or with our 2 boys would be fine.  or if she's running errands around town with our daughter on her day off would work too.  if i've got to take it, it can't be an noisier than my prelude. i'm also going to look at subarus.  foresters have very high residuals right now (65%), but very poor money factors (close to 4%).  the current lame duck legacy &amp; outbacks aren't being backed by crazy incentives - yet."
"July  8, 2014  1:29AM",thebean," i will do that.  it's a promise.  it could be a while before i make up my mind, but i will sure report back when i do. larry c"
"July  8, 2014  1:52AM",henryn," actually, i would agree with that statement.  each of us has a point where we say, ""this is too much.  it simply isn't worth that much.""  each one of us is going to draw that line in the sand at a different point, it might be for the bmw, or for the lamborghini, or for the rolls royce.  but there is a point beyond which we will not go. at one point, quite a few years back, i was stuck with a pmi.  i didn't think too much about it when i first got the mortgage, but with every passing year it bothered me more and more.  the house (and land) appreciated rapidly, and after 5 years i had much more than 20% equity, probably around 35 to 40%.  but the mortgage company would not yield, i had to refinance to get out of the pmi.  and the fees on the refinance cost me nearly $5,000. the mortgage industry is a racket.  they make car dealers look like innocent school boys. the resale value on a cr-v is crazy high.  i can't imagine who would pay that much for a used one (instead of just buying it new), but obviously people do it every day."
"July  8, 2014  2:04AM",nyccarguy," the mortgage industry is a racket .  they find a way to take money from you in every single way possible.  it isn't enough that they literally make hundreds of thousands of dollars off 1 single loan (in interest), they make you pay for insurance to make sure they get paid.  you need a copy of a payoff statement faxed to you?  $20.  yes, $20 each time you call someone, they pull up your file on the computer, &amp; hit send.  now that many people are refinancing, there is a $120 processing fee from the current mortgage company.  they get you coming and going."
"July  8, 2014  2:26AM",driver100," very true.  i just happen to know some cases of people who could afford a better car, but, saving money is more important.  it is nice to be practical and not overspend, but there is a point when some people also don't spend enough.  in the case i am thinking about, the person lives without many nice things that could add enjoyment to his life, but saving money is more important, so he will leave a few $million to relatives who he doesn't really even like. me, i am going to leave my loved ones with all my overdo bills!"
"July  8, 2014  2:52AM",houdini1," i could not agree more. we have all been through it, but when we bought our current home 8 years ago, we were thankfully able to pay cash.  i was shocked when we went to the title company to close. we gave them a check for the house and another check for about $75. for recording fees etc...and that was it. since then my son and i have bought and rehabbed 4 additional houses, paying cash for all of them and selling each one for a nice profit. only used a realtor once. the old saying that it takes money to make money is true, so start saving while you are young. still have to pay those darn real estate taxes each year though...and they keep increasing. grrrrr."
"July  8, 2014  3:33AM",mako1a," i don't have a problem with taxes here in the mountains of virginia. my problem is with insurance. seems like only a few years ago it was 3 or 4 hundred per year. all of a sudden it's closer to $800 per year for house insurance and of course they have disclaimers about water damage and acts of nature (not included). hey, i have a facebook page if anyone else has one. dave rodham is mine and if you can't see my pics, just friend me with your edmunds handle and i'll friend you back so you can see all."
"July  8, 2014  4:30AM",nyccarguy," i have not fared as well as you in the real estate market;) we sold our condo in the nyc suburbs for a loss of approximately $80k.  that money we lost (even if we could have just broken even) was the extra 10% we needed to make the ""standard"" 20% down payment.  so i'm stuck making pmi payments until i can refinance.  i wish i had the time &amp; the capital to flip houses.  being in the plumbing supply business gives me access to so many things at cost."
"July  8, 2014  9:26AM",oldfarmer50, having never had a mortgage i'm unfamiliar with mortgage insurance pmi. is that like gap insurance on car? or is it more like life insurance?
"July  8, 2014  9:42AM",oldfarmer50," yikes! how could you lose money in one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world?  wait? you sold 4 or 5 years ago at the bottom of the market, right? ouch! timing is everything. i keep track of condos for sale down in largo as one of my retirement fantasies. in this one particular development the $160k condos cost $50k in 2009 but have crept back up to $80k today.  i guess i missed my moment."
"July  8, 2014 10:37AM",abacomike,
"July  8, 2014 11:28AM",houdini1," don't worry brad, you are young and have plenty of time to make your way. you would have made a good partner for my son and me. i supplied the capital, he supplied the labor and know how, and you could have supplied the materials. maybe you should find someone you know and trust to team up with."
"July  8, 2014 12:39PM",Michaell," we just closed on the sale of my wife's grandmother's townhome yesterday. she passed in march and the house had been transferred to my fil and his brother many years ago. sadly, my fil passed 8 years ago so his half ownership transferred to my wife and her sister. it, too, needed major updating but the buyer is looking to renovate the property and use it as a rental for college students (property is in ft. collins, home of csu). all cash deal on his end. now to deal with the proceeds - taxes, lawyers, cpas, etc. there might be enough to buy a new car when all is said and done - not that that's what the wife will do with the money, mind you."
"July  8, 2014  1:24PM",stickguy," farmer, yeah, pmi is kind of like gap, to protect the lender from taking a loss if they have to repo. the property. and in terms of losing in a down market, that really only happens usually if you are cashing out.  normally the replacement house is also down in value, so it is basically a wash (or better in % terms if going upmarket)"
"July  8, 2014  1:25PM",jayrider," for some people, living like a pauper despite having millions in the bank, is it's own reward. not spending money brings them joy. it takes all kinds -- to each his/her own."
"July  8, 2014  1:35PM",imidazol97," i believe handling all the recalls thoroughly and quickly, even going to the extreme as to what things are recalled has been the best way to handle this. and it gets people into the doors of the dealerships. some people get a loaner and decide maybe it's time to trade their car in for service for something newer that they drove for a couple of days. it's helping sales."
"July  8, 2014  6:35PM",nyccarguy," thanks for all the kind and supportive words everyone. just as said, it is insurance that protects the bank to make sure they get paid if i default on the mortgage.  it is very expensive.  $12k tacked on to the back end of my mortgage (which i pay interest on) plus an additional $230 per month (over $11k in the 4 years i've owned the house).  the whole thing is a scam.  i borrow money and pay interest on it.  i also have to pay for the bank's insurance (as well as pay interest on it). i bought the condo in january 2004 and sold it in april 2010. i don't feel bad about it.  the best thing i did was sell my condo.  it was built in the early 1970s and the buildings themselves needed constant care which meant major assessments every month on top of the common charges.  your condo might need updating, but at least you've got a beautiful 2014 mercedes-benz benz cls 550 i saw a sexy, white, cls 550 4matic the other day and said to myself  ""i haven't heard from mike in a while, i'll have to check in with him."" i firmly believe that everything happens for a reason.  if i would have taken the 1st offer on my condo, i never would have found my current home as it wouldn't have been on the market yet.  i'm a little far from kansas city to go into business with you and your son.  if i don't get my kitchen done this year, it will be next year. i'm a fantastic husband, father, son, &amp; uncle.  that's what i pride myself on."

"July  8, 2014  7:01PM",driver100," oh, i agree.  but, i don't think it is the best way to be.  it is nice to see people who live well within their means.  on the other hand, having one broken down tiny 30 year old hitachi washer/spin dryer, no air conditioner, not paying for extra cable when he could use the channels, not having air conditioning, wanting to use up anything in the freezer even though it is past the expiry date by years, giving us letters to mail for him and they never have a stamp on them, burning old newspapers and cardboard in the fireplace, etc. etc. is not using the money he has wisely. sure he loves to see it in the bank, but there is a fine balance between saving and getting the most possible out of life, even if you are a careful spender.  what is the point in accumulating money if you will not spend it just to buy some necessities."
"July  8, 2014  8:50PM",driver100," &gt; all i know is canadian real estate never really lost ground in the recession.  year over year prices are up 10%!  but, homes in the us are a bargain, and it is hard to find ways to invest these days and make a profit.  comparable homes in canada are probably 3x or 4x more expensive.  canadians are big buyers in florida and arizona right now.  for what we paid for our florida place you couldn't buy a garage in toronto for that. btw....it is a good thing canadians are helping to stabilize the real estate market. re the elr by cadillac.  the car gets 5 out of 5 on edmunds.  but, how many people buy a 2 door personal car.  i have no idea why gm would build the solscice or the vue...2 seater sports car when the biggest sellers are 4 door car like toyota or fusion.  why pour money and resources into a vehicle that will be of limited interest?  looks like elrs are about $75k with very limited discounts, so they are keeping the price artificially high.  gm shouldn't even be in that market....few are."

"July  9, 2014 12:25AM",ab348, canadians? that's a bit odd. the economy is doing ok but isn't on fire. the exception is alberta where the oil sands are causing a boom. maybe it's rich albertans wanting a luxo-home where it's warm.
"July  9, 2014  1:49AM",driver100," canadians are buying property in florida and arizona, some for investment and some for a place to go in the winter.  many retired seniors are downsizing and can afford a 2nd home in the us. a lot of people have saved and have pensions they know they will be able to manage.  you can buy a condo or small home for the price of an rv camper vehicle.  you can get a nice home for $150k to $200k in the us.  renting can cost almost $1000 a week - could add up if staying 6 months.  it is hard to find anything you would want to live in for under $300k in most cities in canada.  though the canadian economy isn't booming, it is steady, and people with a stream of money are willing to spend it on things they want....like escaping a miserable winter."
"July  9, 2014  1:51PM",fezo," well, i can't read back 185 posts right now.  was up at sloan monday and they don't like what my platelets are up to.  that's been a month now.  i had just hit the once every three months checkup and now i'm back to once a month.  nothing dire but it isn't good.  i suspect a low grade but persistent infection but that's just a guess. it's kind of put my energy at zero but we still went out to a concert that was kind of a celebration for me getting this far.  i paid for anyone that was a caregiver.  not that i have that kind of money but these are people who put themselves on the line when i needed that.  i owe them. doing another show this saturday with one of the guys from that show same place this saturday and then sunday heading out for 12 days more or less to do the great lakes somewhat and visit my donor's family. that trip will be in the newly updated mazda.  i have more or less decided on a ""fun car"" and spend a little of the money doing good things for the mazda (today it gets koni shocks and probably the clutch master cylinder).  this will be good. taking it day to day and have longer term plans that with any luck (and the current situation turning around which i think it will) will happen."
"July  9, 2014  2:01PM",bwia," is gm's onstar big data underutilized? gm's onstar has been collecting data for over 20 years but it would appear that they are not using this data to spot defective and safety trends. not sure what the problem is but i would surmise the data set is too big for meaningful analysis. perhaps, gm should consider sharing these data with other organizations who could drill down into these data and come up with meaningful trends that could be used by the entire auto industry. for competitive reasons they might not share their data but i believe this is a short-sighted approach to consumer safety and protection. any thoughts on big data?"

"July  9, 2014  4:46PM",laurasdada," actually, a boston area caddy dealer is advertising $15k off msrp on all their elrs.  caddy quickly put a $5k dealer spiff on 'em at launch.  the price of the car has uninissanlly been decried as at least 50% too high.  my guess is caddy priced it at $76k so as not to lose money on each one they sell, unlike the chevrolet.  i can't believe caddy expected it to be a big seller.  of course, they made the same pricing mistake, imho, with the xlr and especially the xlrv."
"July  9, 2014  5:21PM",robr2,"  it really depends on what they have been collecting.  in the case of the ignitions turning to the acc position - does onstar collect that data?  if not, should they?  or is that too intrusive?  the tin foil hat people already hate the idea of the ""black box"" that records that last xx seconds prior to an incident."
"July  9, 2014  5:48PM",driver100, i don't think you missed anything too earth shattering....not too many political comments lately. hope you get your platelets back up to speed. let us know how you make out with those shocks.  why did you settle on those and what is that they are supposed to do?
"July  9, 2014  8:50PM",graphicguy," ld...even at $15k off msrp, i still think the elr is a tough sell.  $45k is what i think the magic number is, and that's only because of the additional (and allegedly better ) features and quality of materials over the chevrolet.  they might push that to $50k as an msrp but i wouldn't wager that they'd sell at that price, either (unless some unsuspecting car buyer wanders in off the street, and has had their head wrapped in aluminum foil for the last year or so)"
"July  9, 2014  9:23PM",laurasdada," it's just a tough sell&gt;  even with distinctive styling and a rather nice interior, it's just a tough sell.  too little utility, too much competiton all around that price point.  maybe caddy will slap in ice of some sorts into it..."

"July  9, 2014  9:40PM",oldfarmer50, ha ha count me in with the tinfoil hat crowd.  i don't want some lawyer getting into my pocket because the car squealed on me. over the weekend some knucklehead crashed on i-90 and killed two of his friends.  the police said he was doing 150 mph. even though there were no witnesses.  you can only conclude that they pulled data from the black box. i guess i don't have a problem with that but i worry that some day a pointy headed bureaucrat will show up at my door and give me a ticket based on some black box data. btw he was supposedly driving a volkswagen.  what volkswagen can go 150?

"July 10, 2014  4:24PM",roadburner," that is an entirely different scenario; in your example the evidence was collected and analyzed by  human beings. those same human individuals are available in court to explain how the evidence was collected and analyzed- and these witnesses <em>  are subject to cross-examination </em> . in the case of automated enforcement there is simply one picture from one machine- with no human input or verification whatsoever. would you be comfortable with convicting an individual of murder solely on the basis of written reports, photos, and printouts submitted by the prosecution?"

"July 10, 2014  6:38PM",abacomike," here in the southeast coast of florida, they installed hundreds of cameras at busy intersections to catch drivers passing red lights.  when defendants appeared in court pleading ""not guilty"" with their attorney, 98% of the cases ended up being dismissed.  hondaing to many defense attorneys, for some reason, judges dismissed the charges due to the fact that there was only one picture of a car with a rear license plate as evidence.  even though the picture is taken in the middle of the intersection and the light is ""red"", the judges cited the fact that if the car had entered the intersection while the light was yellow, the driver had not ""passed"" a red light.  there are too many variables such as speed, distance to stop, etc. so, after spending millions of dollars on these cameras and computers, they are starting to remove them because the courts have not determined that they are foolproof evidence of a driver passing a red light.  interesting - spending millions of dollars and the local governments ended up with a bill rather than income from ""red light passers!"" frequently down here in south florida, you can beat a speeding ticket if you were caught on radar and doing only 5 mph over the limit (except in a school crossing areas where the courts determined that 1 mph over the limit was excessive).  it had to do with the different radar units, calibrations, certifications, etc.  but there was no mercy from the courts for going over the 15 mph limit in school zones.  i agree with the courts on that."

"July 11, 2014 10:00AM",oldfarmer50," i seem to remember them costing about $2500 if you paid out of pocket about 5 years ago. those figures can be confusing because in the us if you had no insurance ( no longer possible) there was the figure that you were billed and then there was the amount they would accept as payment if you had no insurance.  the difference was chalked up as a tax loss or as pro bono service.  so a $2500 procedure might actually cost you $1200 out of pocket. when my wife got sick we received a bill of over $50,000 but they accepted about half that.  the only part of the bill that i objected to was the extra 5% tax that the wonderful state of ny accessed on the bill anyone without health insurance to pay the bills of illegal immigrants who were asked to pay nothing."

"July 11, 2014 11:47AM",robr2," one article i found said the average for a colonoscopy to be about $1200 and can range to $4000.  it all depends on where you have it done.  if i go to a place like mass general hospital it will be on the higher end.  if i decide to use dr. jim's bait shop and colonoscopy center, it will cost a whole lot less. as for the pillcam - it's $500 but that's for the camera pill.  i'm sure there is still a cost for the physician to read to the results and all the related overhead."
"July 11, 2014 11:47AM",nyccarguy," they sell the car at a steeply discounted price and give the customer an estimate to fix the car.  good for the dealership because the less car they have to make an insurance claim on, the better."

"July 11, 2014  2:44PM",driver100, $3900 off sounds like a good deal if the car is all fixed up and looks like new.  especially if you were going to keep it for a long time.  how do you create a hailstorm in your area?

"July 11, 2014  4:03PM",henryn," when i had a total knee replacement in 2008, the total cost was well north of $50k.  luckily for me, i have good medical insurance. on the subject of hail damage i ran into this a couple of years ago.  we had a big hail storm, hit a row of new car dealers out on the freeway.  the dealership i was shopping at (ford) had a crew of ""paintless dent removers"" fixing the small dings, and they were offering the damaged car two ways, with and without repairs. the price ""with repairs included"" was still above the ""truecar.com"" bottom line price, so you were not saving any money by buying a car that had been damaged and then repaired.  and the price ""without repairs"" was not very attractive, at least not to me. bottom line, if you're looking for a bargain, this isn't likely to be it."
"July 11, 2014  6:15PM",driver100," that makes me wonder if dealerships just fix up these car and then sell them as new.  do they have to tell you the car survived a hailstorm or can they keep that a secret?  do we have to watch for car caught in floods, and now car left out in a hailstorm? i can't imagine buying one with the idea i would get it repaired myself.  i doubt if you could win on that deal.  since the paint could peel off in areas damaged i don't think it should be saleable as brand new - and potential buyers should know the car has been repaired.  i even wonder about replacing the glass...is a windshield replacement going to be every bit as good as one installed at the factory where there are tight controls and the glass is installed at the optimum time?"

"July 11, 2014 10:56PM",oldfarmer50," i just happened to be at the chrysler dealer today and they had a couple of 200 s types at the front door. not bad looking.  base price was $24k.  i saw one fwd model that was $30k with a v6 (a$2000 option). i saw an awd version for about $34k. too rich for my blood. maybe at $18k but not $30. i was at the dealer because chrysler requires a 5 year inspection to maintain the lifetime power train warranty on wife's pt. that was free.  the safety inspection had expired a week ago so i figured...while i was there.  also had them rotate the tires for $20. promised to do the work in 11/2 hours...took two. they did wash it though...even though i told them not to. as expected they came back with a ""to do"" list.  they said two of the tire pressure monitors were worn and they would do it for $272.  i seem to remember those going for $50 including labor so i declined and then went home to take a shower. reminded me why i use indy shops when possible. also saw some dodges and remembered that hellcat.  $34k for the v6 model. again, too much for too little.  the car looked huge! 20"" tires on a secretary's car? huh?  i'll pass on that boat. saw some 2013 left overs and some ""demonstrators"" on the floor.  one was a 2013 200 with about 13k miles on it.  wonder what discount i could get on that?  i'm thinking 40-50% off msrp."
"July 11, 2014 11:07PM",oldfarmer50," well, my wife had a stroke and was in the hospital and rehab for about 2 weeks."
"July 11, 2014 11:13PM",oldfarmer50," yeah but the advertised price is just the ""hook"" to get you in the door."
"July 11, 2014 11:39PM",driver100," that's probably reasonable for 2 weeks.  we have a friend who collapsed on the volkswagen course while in florida.  one night in hospital with all the tests was $12000.  they couldn't find anything, and believe it was just a temporary thing that can happen. i know we pay for it (through fees and taxes), but both of those would be covered 100% up here."
"July 11, 2014 11:46PM",driver100," &gt; i don't think you can get a dodge for $18k.  the average price of a new car is $32k! the average new vehicle now goes for $32,086, hondaing to interest.com – which works out to a typical monthly payment of $633.  while the number quoted by other tracking services vary slightly, there’s general agreement that prices are rising a good bit faster than the rate of inflation.  truecar.com puts the so-called atp at $32,074 last month, an increase of $1,110, or 3.6%, from february 2013. be interesting to see what you could buy, that you could live with, for $18k.  i doubt it would be new.  maybe that 2013 chyco 200!"
"July 12, 2014 12:42AM",oldfarmer50," edmunds lists the tmv for a new stripper 2013 dodge as $16,400. i don't believe that includes incentives which on a leftover could be a couple thousand more. so $18k might buy something i could live with. pure speculation of course because i'm saving my pennies for something better than a stripper."
"July 12, 2014  1:46AM",driver100," $16500 is a little deceiving considering most people will want to add automatic, power windows and door locks, air conditioning, as a minimum, and that will bring you to over $20k. incentives might bring it down to $18k, but not sure they could discount 10% on a low profit car. when we bought the volkswagen, it was advertised as starting at $19995.  but, no one would or could buy that car in florida.  for one thing, you can't sell a new car in florida without air conditioning.  the s model had cloth material seat that would not wear very well, and didn't look very nice.  drivers seat is hard to adjust to proper position and passenger seat won't move into position.  we pretty well had to move up to an se model which starts at $$22,000.  the $19995 advertised price is just to get you in the door."

"July 12, 2014  2:36AM",nyccarguy," i think volkswagen's ""spotty reliability"" perception haunts them.  they do have some very appealing products.  most of the car don't cater to the hardcore driving enthusiast.  a few years ago they did some very obvious cost cutting on a lot of models.  specifically the volkswagen which had plastics as hard as a brick wall, a non independent rear suspension (if you are going to do that, then it better be paired with a 5.0 l v8 &amp; rwd - good job ford) and a somewhat lackluster naturally aspirated 5 cyl engine.  the sporty gli had the chops with its 2.0 l turbo 4, soft touch interior, &amp; fully independent rear suspension. that's all changed.  volkswagen saw the error of their ways and gave all volkswagens irs, soft touch plastic, &amp; a turbo motor.  there's a diesel option as well as the gli, &amp; hybrid model. i really think if more people would test drive the car instead of just droning back to their honda or toyota dealer every 24 - 36 months they might sell better.  sticker prices might be higher, but they discount steeply and always have some sort of cheapo financing &amp; rebates available. they really do have something for everyone.  want a hatchback?  volkswagen with a 1.8t or tdi.  sportier?  you won't be disappointed with a volkswagen. the sedan have big trunks &amp; back seat made for real people.  how about a luxury 5 passenger suv that gets 28 mpg in the real world ( ?  the toureg tdi.  and oh yeah, it's built on the same platform as a porsche cayenne which costs thousands more. i recently drove a fully loaded volkswagen tdi sel.  the $35 k sticker put me off, but a tdi with sunroof lists for just under 30k.  the car is comfortable, smooth, &amp; torquey.  it is handsome and soaks up road imperfections very nicely without excess body roll and a too soft ""lexus like"" suspension.  people on fuelly.com are creaming epa estimates.  i'm strongly considering it as my next ""buying experience"" or ccba ""card punch."""
"July 12, 2014  2:40AM",stickguy," well, my son was not really considering the volkswagen until we went in and actually test drove it.  that hooked him, and bumped the mazda to 2nd on the list.  the strong lease offer sealed the deal."

"July 12, 2014  1:31PM",robr2," imho, volkswagen sales have dropped because a new fusion and new honda have been introduced since the volkswagen came out.  further, the volkswagen has rather annonymous styling.  lastly, management has said they don't understand the american market and are trying to fix that. imho, most buyers don't know or don't care where the car is made.  in the next 2-3 years, it is expected the mexican made 3 series, cla's and audi's will be rolling into the us from mexican factories.  robots don't care where they work and as long as the proper logo is on the front of the car and they can afford the lease payment, neither will consumers."

"July 12, 2014  2:18PM",driver100," business insider has a good article which answers that question.  it seems the biggest problem is volkswagens cost more than the competition in each category.  they usually cost more because they use more technology in their car.  so, people who are looking for cheap basic transportation will buy a toyota, honda or fusion for $2000 less...most people just care about price.  they don't care about handling, performance or technology. other reasons are poor reliability in the past, and lots of new competition, from companies like hyundai, kia and even ford (focus) and gm (chevrolet). check the article at volkswagen isn't hurting, their sales are up substantially in world sales.  i would guess 80% of buyers only care about price when they buy a car in this category."

"July 13, 2014  2:07AM",roadburner," wrong. it depends on the state- as i mentioned earlier, moving violations in ky are considered criminal offenses, which means all the constitutional safeguards apply. much to the chagrin of the safety gestapo who want to make speeding tickets virtually impossible to defend against."

"July 13, 2014  4:49PM",driver100," i was checking out some things and came across this list of the best luxury car in order hondaing to us news.  the list surprised me, cadillac cts was 1st, audi audi 2nd, mercedes-benz benz e 3rd, lexus 4th, up to 13. i like the way they even include reliability as well as other categories.  some reasons they choose one car over another may not apply in some cases (for example not everyone needs lots of headroom for rear seat passengers), but, facts are facts and the list is worth considering. i'll be looking at an audi more closely, the 535 was 8th after genesis and kia. if you look up sports car the ford is ranked number 4, not too far behind 1,2,and 3.  chevrolet and dodge follow.  there is some good information, and of course i always check edmunds too;"
"July 13, 2014  4:51PM",driver100, youo are right.  i have a feeling 75% of the car buyers don't have a clue what they are doing!
"July 13, 2014  4:59PM",dino001," quite common here.  however it is used most often for nearly new car, with few thousand miles, like demos and such.  using it for three, almost four year old car is ridiculous, not to mention price itself is beyond ripoff."
"July 13, 2014  5:01PM",jayrider, &gt; dishonesty is the engine that runs our economy. just think about all those lies for weight loss miracles and male performance enhancers. advertising distorts everything and guess what ? it works. most of the human race are idiots and fall for this stuff over and over.
"July 13, 2014  5:16PM",henryn," that also doesn't allow for the discount off msrp.  let's face it, when was the last time you or anyone you knew paid msrp?  my last new car purchase (truck actually) was right at 25% off of msrp, thanks to rebates, incentives, and discounts. some days i think that number (75%) is too low."
"July 13, 2014  5:22PM",oldfarmer50, almost next door to driver100's florida house.  if i could get it for under $4k i'd bite.

"July 13, 2014  7:22PM",roadburner, the lincoln dealers around here used to advertise one or two year old lincoln at <strong>  50% off msrp!!! </strong> i always wondered how completely stupid someone would have to be to walk into one of those dealers and pay anywhere close to msrp for a new tc- knowing that their resale prices dropped like a rock...
"July 13, 2014  7:46PM",driver100," unfortunately you could be right....don't forget to add emails from the ex-president of nigeria.  it is sad that people can believe advertisements and politicians.  i can listen to an ad and filter it to dig out some facts.  2 fibre well gummies have 10 calories, 5 gdodges of fibre, 20% of my daily requirements....will it make me ""more"" handsome, taller, wealthier, smarter, popular.....i doubt it."

"July 13, 2014  8:32PM",oldfarmer50," oh, in addition to, for sure.  when i'm buying car in my imagination there is no limit to the available parking spaces. the ford would be for thrills, the lebaron would be for leisurely cruising. in my imagination i'm still 25 and have all my hair too."
"July 13, 2014  9:35PM",imidazol97," an interesting magazine article using other people's reviews and test drives to surmise what they might have found were they to have actually looked at the various car and models themselves at usa today. i looked for their and found their ranking of the 2014 chevrolet at #14, behind even the chrysler. the review incuded all the other reviewers' prejudices and preconceived notions. i often wonder if some of the reviewers actually drove the car. there are 3 different interior levels from what i can tell. the suspension also varies from the ls to the lt, and then the lt2 into the ltz group. add the variations with the turbo motor in the lt3 and the ltz for suspension, and i don't thin some of the reviewers actually tried to understand the vehicle. they aren't driving the same one i have. further proof is that they rate the volkswagen at #15. i think they just dummied up results from whatever they thought would sell the most papers or get the most clicks online."
"July 13, 2014  9:39PM",oldfarmer50, found a craigslist car for isell. i hear it was only driven to church on sunday by a little old nigerian prince. and a few legit possibilities might be comfortable for someone with bone issues. and this good luck.  you're a nice person to be doing this.
"July 13, 2014 10:06PM",stickguy," the cutlass looks ok.  but man, if you are going to bother to take and post pictures, why 3 shots of the passenger side, and nothing else?  my assumption is that the driver's side and interior are trashed, but i might just be a skeptic."
"July 13, 2014 10:34PM",oldfarmer50," i think i told the story of how i was looking at florida craigslist ads for 90s cougars and tbirds  to feed my low-mile rust free fetish with car whose style i liked.  then i saw an ad that mentioned the 32 valve 4.6l engine that came in the marks.  i researched the car and found that all three car were essentially the same except for the engine. then lo and behold i saw a local cl ads for a 1995 mark viii from florida with only 67,000 miles.  it was just what i wanted, rust free, low miles and relatively cheap.  after some encouragement by my edmunds buddies i bought it as my winter beater. definitely a step up from the horrid junk i usually sacrifice to the salt gods. 280hp makes that boat fly.  it's no ford but it'll do. that interior photo you posted is pretty close to mine."

"July 13, 2014 11:50PM",driver100," i went back and looked at us news reviews of mid size affordable car and i think you made some good points imid.  they don't seem to test the car themselves but award points based on reviews and owners comments.  i can still learn a lot from those reviews, there is some good information in them.  it is up to the individual to decide if it matters to them.  the top car, the hondahad 8.7 out of 10.  the chevrolet at 14 had 8 and the volkswagen #15 had 7.9 points.  not a huge spread, but a few points here and there in different categories. the chevrolet lost points to the others because they say, many reviewers point out that there are several affordable midsize car on the market that are more fun to drive, such as the mazdaudi and the ford fusion.  and they say reviewers say that while the updated 2014 chevrolet chevrolet has improved, it still doesn’t stack up well against competitors that offer more refinement, flashier styling or better fuel economy. i think most list the honda as #1 for overall value.  the volkswagen gives up points because it is slow, but they say people who want some fun choose the volkswagen. i really think the list gives you a fair and accurate review of each car.  the information has to be digested to see if it matters.  the chevrolet lost points because  there was less legroom in the rear seat.....if that is not an issue then you can still go with the chevrolet...they do give you all the info you need to make a pretty good decision."

"July 14, 2014  1:34AM",imidazol97," that's an example of why i don't think many actually tried the sit test. they just perpetuate the anti-gm thinking without facts. match the car for 2014 with its rear seat leg room measurement vs media reportage volkswagen sonata toyota chevrolet 39.1 in. 36.8 in. 38.9 in. 38.5 in. as for "" more fun to drive,"" ""more refinement, flashier styling,"" or better fuel economy--two out of 3 are subjective, hence the comment about different suspensions on low models as compared to higher models making a difference. how many reviews of a chevrolet with a noisy (1.8l) engine in the ls have been printed and very few pointed out the 1.4 l turbo engine is much sweeter to drive. for even more subjective fun with facts, match the same 5 car above with gas mileage figures for city/highway 25/36 25/35 24/35 24/35"
"July 14, 2014  1:38AM",driver100," fascinating.  i love a good scam story, there are lots of them out there.  thanks for taking the time to explain it all so well. when i was selling my snow tires 3 years ago on cl a guy called who was on a ship out at sea.  he wanted me to open a paypal account, he would pay, and his friend would come by and pick up the snow tires.  i called cl to see if this sounded good to them, and they say never do it.  only pay if you have the money in your hands.  i couldn't figure out how they would pull off the scam but i am sure where money is involved, they will find a way - they are out there."

"July 14, 2014 12:35PM",imidazol97," well, the point i'm making is that a lot of real world testing by the ""drivers"" and ""evaluators"" doesn't seem really to happen they just report what someone else said  or thought. much talk about changes seems to come from press releases by the companies. as for rear seat room, the chevrolet is not short. instead, the sonata is short. when's the last time a person complained about sonata's (kia's lack of legroom in the rear? never? not on the agenda, is it, so it's not repeated. also check the passenger seat height. my wife would not have been able to get in and out because the seat is low. volkswagen    39.1 toyota    38.9 honda   38.5 chevrolet    36.8 sonata    34.6 as for mileage? doesn't look like there's a king here either. honda uses a cvt and i didn't want to trust being a first year guinea pig for transmissions with honda's track record. it didn't drive bad and much of the odd feeling was just that i'm so used to a 4-speed automatic. honda,   (27/36) chevrolet,   (25/36) toyota    (25/35) sonata    (24/35) volkswagen    (24/35) (volkswagen mileage may be cited for the manual trans. automatic mileage not given.) my point has been fair treatment in the mags and reporting helps the image of gm's products much more than the continual negative ideas passed along."
"July 14, 2014 12:54PM",driver100, $1500 for my dream car!  and $1500 gets me into a cadillac eldarado.  when i was a kid i never thought i would ever have owned a cadillac.....nows my chance.
"July 14, 2014 12:57PM",driver100," i think the reviews were basically good, just have to read between the lines.  if you take out some of the hybrids which they ranked high even if you weren't interested in them, the chevrolet comes in around 10th....and the total marks are close. keep in mind in the luxury department they gave caddie cts first place in a tight field, so i don't think they are bias....just trying to report in an organized way to make it easier to choose."

"July 14, 2014  2:05PM",isellhondas," that taurus will probably get driven less than 2000 miles a year so i didn't care about the miles so much.  on a 800.00 beater, condition is much more important than the odometer reading. as far as records?  nope, just from my face to face meeting with the seller i wasn't worried since he did most of the servicing himself.  his wife made a weekly 80 mile trip in it because the a/c cooled better than her minivan did.  he made sure it was up to snuff so his kids could make the five hour trip to college.  hopefully the damm thing will run for awhile. the 73 year old woman who got it has survived 17 operations for various forms of cancer.  she is the sweetest, giving person you'll ever meet.  her husband died after a long cancer battle seven years ago.  the went through all of their savings and lost their house in the process. she volunteers with me every week at the food bank. all of you would have done the same thing.  i know that."

"July 14, 2014  3:05PM",Kirstie_H," ah, that's an easy one.  first, let's oust the ""friend"" from the equation, because he doesn't exist. so let's say you are asking $200 for your snow tires.  mysteriously, the person ""at sea"" will make an error and overpay you, probably by at least a thousand dollars.  he will do this using a paypal account he has hacked.  it's not his money. then, he'll contact you regarding his error, and ask you to please wire the excess funds to him (or his friend, or whatever).  some time later, the person who legitimately owns the paypal account files a fraud claim, but by then it's generally too late and the money is long gone.  of course the imaginary friend never shows up to pick up the ""items"" or ""merchandise."" years ago, when i had excess time on my hands, i used to mess with the scammers a bit and write back a few times, changing the name of the item i was selling to something like ""box of rattlesnakes.""  i'd always present a few obstacles of my own, such as being blind and unable to fill out the appropriate customs paperwork to ship my rattlesnakes or pile of rusty nails overseas.  it was pretty clear they didn't even read the emails, because my ""items"" that i offered for sale were increasingly ridiculous (say, the item in the ad was a jet ski, and in my response i'd change it).  once, i got a scammer to send me a (fake) cashier's check.  i gave my name as tsarina alexandra romanov and the address to the local police department.  no idea what transpired."
"July 14, 2014  3:26PM",oldfarmer50," i never picked my toes in poughkeepsie--- just received a past due parking notice from a company called laz parking for a violation that occurred at the metro north parking facility in poughkeepsie  about 100 miles away. only problem is i haven't been to poughkeepsie in years, i've never ridden a metro north train, they give no date for the infraction and the plate # they cite doesn't belong to any car i own now or have recently owned. i called their service number and the clerk said it was a ""discrepancy"" because the plate # was a wisconsin plate.  i asked them how it came back to me since i never had that plate # and she just repeated that it was a discrepancy and i could ignore it.  we'll see if that is that. it just got me wondering because a few years ago my son got a parking ticket notice from the city of poughkeepsie which turned out to be an error. do you folks who live in the big cities ever experience this? is someone out to get my family or are they just picking their toes?"

"July 14, 2014  4:07PM",ab348," defending gm is just that. it is not ""prejudicial and biased"". imid has made some valid points using facts and reasonable conclusions. it is not the same as saying ""all gm car are the bestest thing ever"" the way some around here do for their favorite makes. i will state up-front that i am not a fan of the current chevrolet. i do not like the styling or the interior design. but that does not mean i am right and imid is wrong. it is my opinion, that is all. i also have the opinion that he is correct in his opinion that gm vehicles get a rougher ride in the press than some other makes. in fact i believe that it works both ways, that certain makes get a free pass from the automotive press for reasons that remain mystifying. but look at most any review of a chevrolet or a buick and you see comments that just do not jibe with the facts. a lot of auto writers grew up in the ""asian tuner"" generation where anything from across the pacific is good and anything out of detroit is hopelessly bad. add to that resentment from some about the events of 2009 and you have a very toxic point of view for some. i think those biases are real and get into their reviews and - yes - opinions. we all offer opinions here. his are perfectly valid. so are yours. but again, with all due respect, having been on the receiving end of a similar suggestion from you recently on news coverage of the gm recalls, it seems to me your definition of ""objective"" is an opinion that agrees with your own.  that is not what the word means."
"July 14, 2014  4:14PM",abacomike," you are just as biased and prejudiced about gm as imid is.  you both need to tone down your criticism of those of us who provide our opinions about gm.  you have taken me to task many times, as has imid, and i'm just tired of both of you.  period! i've tried to be positive, provide feedback, and this is what i get.  pathetic. you can persist with your biases, but i pay no attention to you both - i've lost my patience with both of you."

"July 14, 2014  6:05PM",Kirstie_H," ^^^ this. we have a large group of people with highly diverse backgrounds, experiences, and vehicle preferences.  we are all biased. even editorial reviews, which proclaim themselves to be ""unbiased"" are frequently accused of having bias.  if that's the case, why would we expect that this, a connissantional forums discussion, to be free of bias? sometimes i marvel at the strong biases of members in various parts of our forums, and what i perceive as blind loyalties, or failures to recognize failures or to give credit where it's due.  i shrug and move on. let's not intentionally go to war over a matter so trivial as other members' favored/unfavored manufacturers or vehicles."
"July 14, 2014  6:19PM",driver100," thanks for the explanation....greatly appreciated....i couldn't see how they were going to pull off the scam i like your little way of getting back at the scammers.  a guy with a heavy accent called and wanted to clean our ducts.  i told him i had 12 filthy ""ducks"" and would really like them cleaned up, they were making a mess of the house.  we went around in circles, him trying to explain what he did, me not getting it.  he finally hung up...it was fun beating a scammer."
"July 14, 2014  6:27PM",driver100," it's not worth having a flare up over.  we have done really well here considering the number of posts posted every day.  there are forums where people are having disagreements constantly.  imid is making a point which he honestly believes is happening, and mike has picked up on that.  just different point of views.....let's just leave it and maybe we can learn something from it."

"July 14, 2014  6:43PM",isellhondas," when my stepdad was in his final months, somehow the money suckers found out about him. i had to get all of his mail sent to us or he probably would have been suckered in. they would usually include a dollar bill and ask for donations to whatever silly cause they were pushing.  i'm not talking about mainstream charities here.  they would even include a stamped self addressed envelope. somehow i had gotten ahold of a large box of thin but heavy 3x3 refrigerator magnets and a large supply of monopoly money. i would stuff the envelopes full of heavy magnets and monopoly money and send it to them. no doubt there would be a lot of postage due when these arrived. funny how quickly these mailings stopped."

"July 14, 2014 11:12PM",driver100," no doubt there would be a lot of postage due when these arrived. i like getting back at scammers.  another one i want to get back at is perspective employers.  after i got canned from my 3rd job in 4 years i went to some job interviews.  most companies made me wait for a long time, and then they didn't even acknowledge me coming to the interview...not even a form rejection letter. i sometimes feel like applying for jobs, having a fantastic resume, and then showing up in old jeans with 4 days of stubble.  knocking things off the hr persons desk, falling out of my chair, spilling coffee on the floor etc.  there is one company in particular that i would like to do it to. do you think it would be illegal?  now that i am retired it would make for a very entertaining day, and what a story i would have."
"July 15, 2014 12:11AM",stickguy," darn driver, retirement does sound like fun! car related, you can go back to all the dealers that screwed you around somehow.  dress expensive, drive the nice car in, then spend the day test driving and negotiating with all the sales managers.  spend the day, and get them all jumping to write up a few expensive car at lay down prices. then at the end, say you have to check with the wife, get up, and leave."

"July 17, 2014 12:44PM",bwia," the suv/cuv craze hondaing to the ny times, quoting the ihs, the suv and cuv have surpassed the sedan in popularity and registrations in 2014. don't know what that will do for the cafe standards but either the suv has to shrink in size (a la sub-compact cue) or go the hybrid route. personally, i like the suv and my next new car purchase will likely be an suv. i have been driving my wife's brand new buick buick and i loving it. the cue appeals to two demographics, the empty nesters and the millenniums. because of its compact size it is easy to park. additionally, the high riding position improves visibility and makes it much easier for ""seniors"" to enter and exit."
"July 17, 2014  1:38PM",driver100," on the other hand, i have had two jeeps and the bmw x3, and i equate suvs with being work vehicles.  i prefer having a trunk where liquids and packages are separated from the passengers, i don't like the cargo area to be part of the passenger cabin, i like the lower centre of gravity a car has, i like the dynamics of driving a car.  some suvs aren't that easy to get in and out of especially for rear seat passengers.  if we do have rear seat passengers it is nicer for them to be in the passenger area, and not next to the cargo area. i know there are great advantages in having an suv as well, just saying, it isn't necessarily the best for everyone."
"July 17, 2014  1:47PM",stickguy," a cuv at this point is really just a tall station wagon.  in my case, i do use the cargo capability of ours.  i don't think a sedan could function for us as the family truckster. plus after 16 years in a minivan my wife likes to sit up a little higher. the rdx though is small and light vs. a real suv.  i don't think my mpg is much different than a tl gets, which would be the analogous sedan.  heck, it gets better on the highway than my older tl."
"July 17, 2014  2:20PM",robr2," not a whole lot.  the cafe standards that went into place in 2011 based a vehicle's fuel economy requirement on a algorithm that takes length and width into account.  basically larger vehicles have lower requirements.  a honda fit has to meet 36 mpg cafe/29 published target while an ford has to meet 22 mpg cafe/17 mpg published. the bigger the vehicle, the lower the cafe target.  but manufacturers still have to meet an overall target.  sell too many large vehicles and it may not reach the target."
"July 17, 2014  2:23PM",bwia," oops, in my above post, i meant cuv, not cue. stick, my daughter just bought a 2015 acura rdx. although she likes a lot she,  however, misses the space she enjoyed of her large honda minivan."
"July 17, 2014  2:25PM",robr2," i returned last night from a 4 day college tour through winston-salem and durham, nc, williamsburg, va and washinpontiacn, dc.  great bonding experience with my son.  he developed some very strong opinions about what type of school he wants to go to.  looks like georgetown and william and mary are right up there along with a couple schools here in boston. coming home we were on the nj turnpike.  having not been there in years, it looks like they added all new lanes on the outside and are not redoing the old lanes.  are they planning on high occupancy vehicle/high occupancy toll lanes?"
"July 17, 2014  2:25PM",stickguy," we miss the space occasionally.  as i knew we would.  the pending trip to take my daughter to college will be one if them.  but overall in 2 years, we have managed fine and love driving it.  just needs a bigger gas tank!"

"July 17, 2014  3:06PM",robr2," tesla announced the model e nee the model 3 about 2 years ago as their next product after the model s.  looks like the model x (suv) became a priority for them.  imho, the model x came first because it can be sold at a premium to cover the cost of the batteries.  with the gigafactory, the hope is that the battery cost will drop low enough to allow for a $35k price,"
"July 17, 2014  3:51PM",Mr_Shiftright," if it can't go 300+ on a charge, it's not going to sell very well imo. for 35k, it should behave like a ""normal"" car."

"July 17, 2014  7:10PM",bwia," the college one  selects is not as important as the quality of engagement a student has with his professor. so why then, do parents spend a fortune on a highly selective college misguidedly believing that it makes a difference. as you begin thinking of a college for your child, or for a child who is not happy with his or her current college, this article and related study, might prove to be instructive. perhaps some  of you have seen the news reports about a survey of 30,000 college graduates across the us by gallup and purdue university.  just thought i i'd share an op ed piece in the nyt by charles m. blow which references the poll as well as the link to the gallup/perdue poll results. here is an excerpt the report has a strong message for students who are asking about which school to attend, for employers who are deciding which people to hire and for colleges that are negotiating their curriculums. it concluded “the data in this study suggest that, as far as future worker engagement and well-being are concerned, the answers could lie as much in thinking about aspects that last longer than the selectivity of an institution or any of the traditional measures of college. instead, the answers may lie in what students are doing in college and how they are experiencing it. those elements — more than many others measured — have a profound relationship to a graduate’s life and career.”"
"July 17, 2014  7:28PM",stickguy," like it or mnot, name value counts.  but in particular with elon, they are big on the engagement piece. hard to avoid getting involved there! feel free to im later if you have questions."
"July 17, 2014  9:41PM",ab348," i spent nearly a week in williamsburg last fall and explored the william and mary campus a bit. as you say, it is a lovely spot. but i found myself wondering how the students fit in to the community and what they do when they are not in class. i didn't find williamsburg the most fun sort of place to be honest. actually it was kind of nice to sit on a bench near the campus and watch the young people coming and going, laughing, talking, smoking, playing music, etc. the rest of the community seemed rather touristy and stuffy, not a place a college student would enjoy very much."
"July 17, 2014 10:27PM",snakeweasel," oh i don't know, i think that the magic number for an electric car range would be somewhere between 150 to 200 miles. so a 200 mile range electric car could do well even if it's in the mid 30's price wise. especially if it's a two car family and the other car is gas powered. case in point, most people rarely drive more than 200 miles in a day. as for me there have been a couple of times this year when i would have run a nissan battery dry in a single day but i would have made it with a 200 mile range car. but i am hard pressed to remember a day this year where i went over 200 miles."
"July 17, 2014 10:54PM",stickguy," ab, that was how we felt about w&amp;m.  odd set up.  turned my daughter off actually."
"July 17, 2014 11:48PM",robr2," my son was disappointed with both.  he felt that wf was ""manufactured"" in that the campus is only 60 years old but they were trying too hard to make it seem as old as their original campus.  the info session presenter and the tour guide were both 2nd generation demon deacons and that too much emphasis was put on this.  further, the campus itself isn't part of winston-salem - it's too far away.  as for duke, he didn't like that there are multiple campuses and that the freshman are all on one of them.  he also felt that there was too much emphasis on the athletic progdodges and kids camping out for 3 months to get basketball tickets.  also, the undergraduate population is smaller than the graduate population making it more difficult for undergrads to get research opportunities. wherever he goes, it's all about being involved in clubs, sports, social opportunities.  college is what you make of it."

"July 18, 2014  9:14AM",oldfarmer50," you sound like isell.  he had the same opinion of the previous generation rivieras. i kind of like the quirky looks of those early 90s models and last generation as well.  the top line model had a turbo 3.8l with 260hp., not bad for it's day. what struck me was the total detachment from reality that someone would value any 15 yo car with 200k miles at $30,000."
"July 18, 2014 11:45AM",snakeweasel,
"July 18, 2014  1:01PM",graphicguy," that was my first thought.  i think it's a $1,500-$2,000 car, with that sort of mileage on it. comparing it to a $70k jag?  really?  i like rivs.  have driven quite a few, including a couple of the late '90s vintage.  to me, they're probably the pinnacle of gm's styling of that era.  they couldn't in any way, shape or form mimic a jag, bmw, audi etc of the same vintage."
"July 18, 2014  1:08PM",thebean," does the rdx take premium or regular gas?  i refuse to buy a car that requires premium.  the rdx looks like something i would be interested in, but not if it requires premium. thanks in advance for your answer. larry c"
"July 18, 2014  1:12PM",nyccarguy, you live in texas.  i thought gas was cheap down there. i think his rdx sucks down premium.
"July 18, 2014  1:27PM",thebean," gas is relatively inexpensive here - right now regular is anywhere from $3.30 to $3.50/gal.  i just hate to pay that extra $0.20/gal or so for premium.  i'm semi-retired and try to get by as cheaply as possible.  i used to have an mercedes-benz benz merc that took premium and i cringed every time i filled it up.  of course, some would say if you can afford a merc, you can afford premium gas.  point taken.  but, i was working full-time then. thanks for the word on the rdx.  i appreciate the response.  that's a shame for cheap ol' me. larry c"

"July 18, 2014  4:54PM",driver100," i am not sure, but this thought struck me and others can comment.  my 535 takes mid grade gas and lets say it costs about 7 or 8% more than regular gas. is it possible, that because the engine is running at peak performance (since it needs premium fuel) and is more finely engineered, that the car could easily get an extra 10% more mileage. i get 28 mpg on the highway and 24 mpg mixed driving, which i think is pretty good for 300 hp and a pretty heavy car.  would i get that same mileage with a car with a less efficient engine that runs on regular fuel?"
"July 18, 2014  5:39PM",bwia," premium is recommend but my daughter uses regular with no adverse effects. the gas mileage has been about 26 on average.  on the highway, with no traffic, fuel economy has been about 30  with a high of 32 mpg. my daughter drives the base model (sans tech package) but i believe the all-wheel drive model requires (?) premium. nonetheless, the rdx sips premium at a frugal rate considering the size and power of the 273-hp v6 engine. with all wheel drive, mpg is about 1 mpg less. here is a link and specs for the 2015 rdx. good luck with your purchase."
"July 18, 2014  6:29PM",Mr_Shiftright," yep, $1500 is about market correct for that buick."
"July 18, 2014  6:30PM",nyccarguy," ""my 535 takes mid grade gas"" your bmw requires premium (91 octane or greater), you put 89 (mid grade) in it."
"July 18, 2014  6:31PM",Mr_Shiftright," re an ev with 200 mile range but that's like saying ""plugging it in is the convenient way of overcoming the inconvenience"". why buy a problem just because you can solve it? even if you have an air compressor in your garage, you wouldn't buy tires that go flat everyday."
"July 18, 2014  6:36PM",ab348," my buick turbo takes premium and while i hate to pay for gas as much as anyone, i knew that fact going in and it hasn't bothered me too much. if anything i have peace of mind that the fuel i put into it is about as good as i can get (i use v-power whenever i can get it). i retired at the end of may and find i am barely driving at all now compared to when i was working. i doubt i will need to fill up more than once a month now, if that, so the cost of premium isn't really an issue."

"July 18, 2014  7:58PM",bwia," help me understand this a little better, is 89 premium or regular? if the manufacturer says <em>  requires </em> premium, and you use 89 octane, would that invalidate your warranty? reminds me of the old miller lite beer commercial great taste or less filling."
"July 18, 2014  8:23PM",Michaell," 89 is mid-grade, 91 is premium. i understand that some stations back east offer 93 octane, and regular unleaded is usually 87. except for high altitude states - here in colorado regular is 85, mid-grade is 87 but premium is still 91. in new mexico, it's 86/88/91. not so certain about the warranty issue - but, why chance it? both my wife's cx-7 and the daughter's mini take premium. i only use shell v-power in the mazda, while the daughter gets her gas from whatever station is most convenient - but she still uses 91 octane."
"July 18, 2014  8:28PM",nyccarguy, is 89 in canada considered premium?

"July 18, 2014  9:59PM",bwia," speaking of retirement, was it difficult for you guys to make the social security decision? start taking benefits early (62 to 65), at full retirement age (66), or to delay to age 70? a friend of mine who is 66, and who does not plan to retire until 68, is agonizing over whether he should take benefits now or wait until when he retires at 68 when the benefits will be 16% higher. hondaing to the social security administration, it does not really matter when you start taking benefits because your cumulative amounts will be the same. anyone care to share their experiences or wisdom on this subject?"
"July 18, 2014 11:25PM",driver100," that's funny about the miller commercial.....great taste or less filling. regular gasoline has 87 octane.  premium fuel can have 89 octane and a higher grade of premium fuel has 91.  most car that need premium fuel do need higher grade 91.  i think bmw realized people don't like paying for 9 92. full 91 octane premium fuel, so they tuned the car to 89 octane.  my car definitely says to use 89 octane.  everything i have read says using a higher octane fuel than specified is a waste of money. i would still be interested in knowing if higher octane fuel equates to better mpg, and may actually end up costing less."
"July 18, 2014 11:31PM",driver100," michael, i will agree with you except on one fine point and it is interpretation.  to me, regular grade fuel is normally 87 octane where i drive, by definition if i pay more for fuel then 89 or 91 octane fuel is premium fuel....that is i am paying a premium if i use it.  i agree 89 is mid range premium, and 91 is high test premium, but both are premium fuels. on the inside of the door panel i am advised to use 89 octane fuel. also, one an exxon station was out of 89 and 91 so i used 87.  i didn't notice a difference but mileage didn't seem as good (hard to judge, could be traffic or weather).  but, i wouldn't do that normally to try to save a few bucks.  though, i think i read under non stressful conditions the computer system can probably work with that."
"July 18, 2014 11:33PM",driver100," nyc...only by my definition...if 87 is regular, anything i pay for above that is a premium fuel.  89 is mid range premium, 91 is high test premium, and sunoco goes up to 94 i believe...to me those are all premium by definition...if you pay more you are paying a premium."
"July 18, 2014 11:39PM",driver100," this is drivers basic rule.  if you can live nicely without taking early retirement then you may as well wait.  if it will make your life better now, then take it now.  with my luck, if i wait, something will happen and i will never collect on my pension money.  secondly, you will recieve a few years worth of payments, which will take a few years to catch up if you leave your payments until later.  the driver says, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, especially when it comes to anything having to do with the government."

"July 19, 2014 12:11AM",oldfarmer50, i decided to go for it as early as possible because i want to use the money to enjoy myself while i still can.  i sure don't intend to have extra money later in life only to give it to a nursing home or funeral parlor. my only tough choice is weather to keep working full time.  as it turns out i'll have to give back most of my benefit because i'll make way over the $15k limit.  most people say i'm nuts but i'd rather have even part of the money now.  it'll balance out later because i'll get more when i reach 66 and my pension from work will be higher as well. everybody's situation is different.

"July 19, 2014 12:19AM",ab348," regarding canada pension (like social security). i turn 58 next week so i won't have to make that decision for a couple of years. my pension is ""acurated"" with cpp so when i turn 65 it goes down and the cpp makes up the difference to keep me whole, so if i take it at age 60, i will be enjoying 5 years of extra money but at age 65 i take a hit for the rest of my life. i'm thinking i'll take it at 65 right now."
"July 19, 2014 12:40AM",berri," <em>  hondaing to the social security administration, it does not really matter when you start taking benefits because your cumulative amounts will be the same </em> i dunno, i think i'd do the math. first question is do you need the difference in monthly payment now or do you expect to cash in your chips fairly early? if not, i'd either run a present value or a compound interest extrapolation over a high and a low death age estimate. even if the cummulative payments are equal, the compounded value over time will not likely be (but if the monthly cash payouts are equal cumulatively and you don't need the cash, but invest the difference instead, you might end up better off over your remaining lifetime with a decent investment return).  finally, by waiting your surviving spouse (if applicable) will get a higher survivor's payout if that is going to be higher than what they would get on their own. all things being equal, personally i'd probably hold out for the later, but higher payment. but everyone's financial situation, or priorities, are different and no one size fits all. good luck! ultimately it's really about living your remaining years, not maximizing investment returns."
"July 19, 2014 12:58AM",driver100," most sites that talk about octane do call 87 octane regular, 89 mid grade (though to me it is still premium because i am paying a premium for it) and some say over 90, some say 91, and this one says 92 or 93 octane rating is premium. what are octane ratings? octane ratings measure a gasoline's ability to resist engine knock — a rattling or pinging sound that results from premature ignition of the compressed fuel-air mixture in one or more cylinders. most gas stations offer three octane grades regular (usually 87 octane), mid-grade (usually 89 octane), and premium (usually 92 or 93). the ratings are posted on bright yellow stickers on each gas pump."
"July 19, 2014  1:43AM",driver100," calling 87 regular, and 89 mid-range and 91 premium is about the same as what the car rental companies call different size car; the ford focus is a terrific car. but anyone who's driven one knows that while it may be economical, reliable and peppy, there is one thing that it is not intermediate sized. even if enterprise rent-a-car calls it that. that's just one example of the confusion consumers face when trying to find the right car to rent. unfortunately, the rental industry continues to struggle with product standardization so you're often left scratching your head when comparison shopping from site to site and weighing one firm against another. to make matters even stickier, with a few exceptions it's virtually impossible to secure a specific make and model at most rental companies. class warfare on its website, enterprise defines the intermediate class as ""chevrolet chevrolet, ford focus, or similar"" and provides this description ""larger than an economy and compact car rental, our standard car [sic] balance the space and budget to give you a great deal on your car rental."" the problem is that budget and hertz—which both feature ford vehicles—list the focus as a compact, one step below intermediate or midsize. similarly, the chevrolet is called a compact by alamo, avis, and national i guess we could say a rose is a rose, or something like that."

"July 19, 2014  2:38AM",roadburner," i'm sorry, but i simply just do not see the reason for all the hand-wringing over a car that uses premium. lets say that you drive 15,000 mile/year and your car gets 28 mpg. you'll use 536 gallons every year. assuming the delta between regular and premium is 30 cents/gallon will mean that using premium will cost you an extra $161/year- <em>  a whopping 44 cents per day </em> . oh the horror...

"July 19, 2014  3:54AM",stickguy," the rdx recommends premium for best performance, but regular is ok. i often use regular and notice no difference.  just took a trip today and got 32 mpg on i think mid grade."

"July 20, 2014  1:25PM",houdini1," i am no expert either, but this is my understanding. the more ethanol that is added the poorer your mpg because ethanol has less energy or some such. it is very hard to find ethanol free gas in the u.s. virtually no ethanol free reg. you can find ethanol free prem. but you have to look for it and it costs more. also the ethanol is supposed to be very hard on things like gaskets, hoses, and such...and recently many are saying ethanol is worse than gasoline on the environment, etc. moving to ethanol was more a political thing in the u.s. it sounds like ethanol free gasoline is easier to find in canada. i try to use it here whenever possible. i have also heard that some car companies will void your warranty if you use over a certain percentage of ethanol. maybe 15%?  hopefully someone else knows more about this."
"July 20, 2014  1:37PM",stickguy," ethanol has more issues with water in the system, and gunk gumming up the works. it was supposedly implemented as a way to reduce dependency on foreign oil.  at this point, it is mandated because the huge agra conglomerates make a fortune out of it, and they own enough of congress that common sense or real science will never take over."

"July 20, 2014  5:18PM",driver100," i am not sure american brands are neglecting seniors....they seem to attack it a different way.  there is no doubt cadillac is catching on.  they are aiming for seniors who want more performance and better handling from their car....they know just because a car is a cadillac doesn't mean it will impress anyone.  i don't think there was much of a market left for car like the buick lucerne.  that is the old style barge, wrong image.  but the newer smaller buick with turbos could win back some seniors.  then there is lincoln...you would have to be an older senior who is looking for a car that used to impress people with it's name.  lincoln just isn't a younger seniors kind of car. it seems cadillac and to a lesser degree buick are on the right track.  the big problem is turning around their images.  i know our mercedes-benz benz 1999 and 2003, all our bmw and the audi are all fun car to drive and they have a level of handling and performance that please a huge part of the luxury market.  why would i risk going back to a brand that i left many years ago...to give them another try?  i don't change just for the sake of change or to save a few dollars.  the d3 have to earn my business and i don't see it happening anytime soon.  more than that, i'd have to be very unhappy with our current bmw or audi to make me change brands....or, much better alternative has to appear on the market. i have done the gm, ford, chrysler thing, and i liked those car at the time, but, there would have to be a very good reason for me to go back."
"July 20, 2014  5:19PM",houdini1," very astute observation bwia. the problem with the older demographic from a marketing view is that, while they have the wealth, they just don't buy car as often as younger people. i think that is one of the reasons for gm's marketing change. it will be interesting to see if this works for them."
"July 20, 2014  5:21PM",driver100," mike, keep us posted, our hearts are with you."
"July 20, 2014  5:28PM",driver100," that is true, and the article mentioned that.  seniors will buy the car they have always wanted, and they know they can now afford it (empty-nest, no mortgage, pension they can live on), but, they don't put a lot of miles on their car, and as the article said, todays car can last a long time. that means the seniors who do buy luxury car and who buy 1/3 of those car, are buying them less often.  if they bought more often they would be an even larger percentage of the total. some car like the 535 are a little softer to attract the older demographic, however, there is enough handling and performance to make the car fun to drive.  maybe the problem is, how do you get seniors to buy more often.  possibly better technology and easier to use technology (rear camera, car that park themselves, easier to use gps, bluetooth etc.)."

"July 20, 2014  6:13PM",ab348," i guess that depends on how you define it. canada pension plan is something you pay into while you are working, cost-shared by the employer. you can begin to withdraw it as early as age 60, at a reduced rate. it used to be that full amounts started at 65, but they are increasing that now to 67 and you supposedly get more if you wait to start until then. then there are the other govt pensions that are not employment-related, which kick in at age 65 iirc. i need to learn all about this stuff now. i admit to total ignorance on the subject. i an lucky in that i get a decent work pension after 32 years of employment, so i am retired now at 57. i have had some health issues so that colors things a bit, but i honestly don't think i could have lasted working much longer. the last couple of years i felt tired and bored at work, and i know i wasn't as productive as i once was. handling the same issues over and over again just wears you down. i'm so glad i no longer have to do performance appraisals, business plans, etc."
"July 20, 2014  6:16PM",roadburner," i think that there is a lot of truth to the adage, ""you can sell an old man a young man's car- but you can't sell a young man an old man's car."" that said, more than a few of my friends who were car nuts in their youth have become 100% old farts, buying a depressing succession of appliances and geezer-mobiles. me, that's my textbook definition of hell- especially if you throw in a few minivans..."
"July 20, 2014  8:23PM",stickguy," speaking of canada, did they expand national health care to include a travel trailer for every family?  i came down from upstate ny (albany) saturday, back to jersey, and we saw so many large trailers with quebec tags that it seems the entire province evacuated.  i assume many of them were headed to the jersey shore."

"July 20, 2014 11:49PM",stickguy," the audi is much more than a tarted up volkswagen.  not even on the same platform at this point.  the base engine is the same though, but that is normal corporate action. look at them side by side, and i doubt you will find much commonality.  far from a cimmeron/chevrolet arrangement!"
"July 21, 2014 12:01AM",ab348," uh, no. what is your source for this report? this is old news from a couple of weeks ago. from bloomberg ""the detroit-based automaker issued an urgent order dated july 8 to its dealers to stop delivery of 2014 cadillac cts sedan that use a standard key ignition. the order didn’t apply to the newest models with a push-button start. the notice became public after the u.s. national highway traffic safety administration posted the document today as part of its continuing investigation of gm vehicle recalls. gm, in the notice, also told dealers not to sell 2003-2013 models of the cts and 2004-2006 models of the cadillac cadillac from their used-car inventories. gm said in a july 16 letter to nhtsa that dealers will supply two replacement key rings to affected car, and those with slotted keys will also receive key inserts. the letter said only 258 cadillacs from the 2014 model year are affected by the stop-delivery order."""

"July 21, 2014 12:50AM",roadburner," that generation m3 is a bit of an odball; the us version got a hopped up version of the standard engine rather than a true ///m motor.what hurts this car in my eyes is the slushbox and the droptop. as far as repair expense goes, not a lot goes wrong with that vintage, and the fact that the motor is rather plebeian is a bit of an advantage. suspension bushings and the cooling system are the the main areas that will eventually need attention, but the droptop and slushbox hold the potential for some annoying issues. i think the price is on the low side, actually..."

"July 21, 2014  5:21PM",stickguy," the problem to me isn't the fact you normally don't do 200 miles in 1 day.  it is that you never can. now, if you are looking at an ev as purely a 2nd/commuter car (always around town, to the station, short hops) with a 2nd car available for any travel or longer drives, then you can make a case for it.  but there is no way i am planning on one for an out of town/longer trip. how about a nice portable generator on a trailer?  just hook that up and charge as you go!"
"July 21, 2014  5:53PM",houdini1, they already thought of that...it's called a hybrid ! my thought is to use those 200 mile batteries with a hybrid like the toyota or toyota...or put a small gasoline engine in the tesla.

"July 21, 2014  6:39PM",abacomike," i came to the same conclusion as did you, snake, about 6 months ago.  additionally, i choose gas ""brands"" using the same philosophy and extrapolation.  as an example, if costco is selling their premium grade for 18 cents a gallon less than my chevron station, i choose the chevron station over costco.  remember, the only credit card company that is accepted at costco is american chevrolet down here.  american chevrolet does not consider costco a gasoline station, for some reason - thus i get no cash back. on the other hand, my chase and discover cards are accepted at chevron stations and i get a minimum of 1% back on each purchase.  so that drops the cost of the gas by 4 cents.  twice a year (july 1-sept. 30 and again jan. 1 - march 30) i get 5% back on each purchase, which makes buying chevron even better than costco. but to get back to your comments about using a lower octane gas because of pricing - it really is insignificant when you consider the difference."

"July 21, 2014  6:48PM",abacomike," speaking of taking social security and pension benefits sooner than full retirement age, i took both my illinois pension and social security pension a bit early. i took my illinois pension starting at age 62, or 3 years sooner than full retirement.  i figured it out that i would break even at age 71, and then i would begin losing ground after that.  i reach 71 in october of 2015.  so, i've been collecting retirement benefits for quite some time and cola increases each year, as well. for social security, i took it at age 64, or 2 years earlier.  the way the ssa figured out for me, i would break even at age 74. so for me, earlier retirement made sense since i have quite a few health issues and don't expect to live to be 80 or 85. the increases in social security over the past 4 years has been meager, if anything.  food prices have been rising at 8-10% per year but my increases in ss have been 1-2%.  the way they figure cola increases for ss is somewhat mind-boggling. early retirement options are good depending upon the break-even age.  in my case, it was better to retire a few years earlier than to wait since i had to care for my dad and could not work."

"July 21, 2014  7:00PM",thebean," thanks very much for this info.  that's pretty good mileage, especially if she uses regular gas.  i would be probably interested in the same model - base model with no tech pkg."
"July 21, 2014  7:06PM",thebean," mike, i'm so sorry about your daughter.  even though i don't know you, i have enjoyed reading  your posts.  it's a terrible thing for a parent to outlive a child.  both of my parents outlived one of my sisters, and my mother outlived my other sister.  they were as sad as i ever saw them during that time.  your family will be in my prayers."
"July 21, 2014  7:14PM",stickguy," speaking of mpg,  my wife followed me up to ny last friday ( i was driving a rental truck).  so our normal route, but slower.  mostly highway, just at 62-65 vs. the normal 73-75 or so.   when we arrived, the rdx tc was sitting right at 32 for the 250 mile trip.  i got about 29 coming back at normal speeds, and 28-29 is about the best i can usually do on that trip up. but man you get whiplash watching car fly by!   and it does take longer."
"July 21, 2014  8:01PM",snakeweasel,
"July 21, 2014  8:44PM",stickguy," one problem with the slow route is that in many cases, including the trip i was on, it doesn't really exist.  unless you want to turn a 4 hour trip into an 8 hour one! so the option is to just drive slow on the same highway.  nothing relaxing or scenic about that!"
"July 21, 2014  9:01PM",roadburner," but it pales in comparison to other expenses connected with a vehicle purchase- depreciation, options, etc. and it is especially laughable when those complaining are flipping new car every 2-4 years..."
"July 21, 2014  9:21PM",henryn," we purchased a new 2008 volkswagen, with the 2.0t engine.  the owner’s manual, and the decal on the fuel filler door recommended 91 octane.  the dealer said regular, 87 octane was fine.  i spent quite a few hours researching this, reading other opinions out on the various volkswagen and other model specific forums.  i decided that i felt better about running the premium fuel, and we did so. 103,000 miles over the course of 6 years.    overall mpg average was close to 25, so 4,120 gallons of gas.  sometimes premium was 20 cents per gallon higher, sometimes 30 cents.  so call it an average of 25 cents per gallon.  4,120 gallons times 25 cents more per gallon, comes to $1,030.   divide that by 72 months, it cost us $14.30 per month, and i always felt good about my decision. as roadburner said just above, compared with depreciation this is not a big deal."
"July 21, 2014  9:26PM",stickguy," the price delta drives me nuts.   always used to be about $.10 per step.  now, it seems to be much bigger. i got gas yesterday at exxon.  rug was 3.33.  mid grade was 3.69, and pug was 3.89.  so r to p was $.56.  that is getting up there.  but sometimes at the sunoco i use it is only about $.25 or so. what really seems odd is why 89 octane isn't 1/2 way between the other 2, since i believe they just blend the 2 to create it!"
"July 21, 2014  9:28PM",oldfarmer50," that assumes a real 200 mile range.  what happens when you run ac, heater, radio etc.?  i briefly considered a mitsu electric but the real world range just wouldn't accommodate my 50 mile average daily commute."
"July 21, 2014  9:33PM",stickguy," 50 miles/day is way past my comfort level for an ev.  when i was going to my office, it was about 3 miles of stop and go down the road, so perfect for that."
"July 21, 2014  9:39PM",robr2," i've also seen the differential jump from $0.20 to close to $0.40 on rug to pug.  imho, it's because rug is more of a commodity item than pug.  people who use but don't need pug can drop down.  those of us with vehicles that require pug don't have a choice. as for the extra cost, over 9+ years and 115k miles, i've spent an extra $12 a month for premium in my volkswagen using $0.25 differential."

"July 21, 2014  9:41PM",oldfarmer50," mike, your example is exactly why i took my ss the minute it was available.  right now i can enjoy the extra money, tomorrow who knows. i look at my parents as an example.  when they were in their early to mid 60s they were active, traveled, volkswagened, you name it.  10 years later their health problem and age made them stay-at-homes.  at that point they didn't need the money they had, let alone extra money. as for my pension, i'm in my best earning years and since nys calculates benefits on you best 36 consecutive months i'm banking money every day i keep working."

"July 22, 2014  1:19PM",ab348, the only way a 409 '62 chevrolet could do 0-60 in 4 seconds is by dropping it off a tall building... maybe with jet-pack assist.

"July 22, 2014  3:21PM",roadburner," if you look back at the muscle car tests from 1964-1970 you'll find that a lot of the press car were seriously ""massaged."" on top of that, the drag race oriented mags such as <em>  hot rod </em> and <em>  car craft </em> would often remove the air cleaner, power steering belt, advance the timing, and throw on a set of ""cheater"" slicks."

"July 22, 2014  6:18PM",bwia," for social security, i took it at age 64, or 2 years earlier. the way the ssa figured out for me, i would break even at age 74. very good rational for starting benefits early. a restsaturnnt owner friend of mine started  taking social security benefits at 62 while he continues to work full-time. *snake probably can explain the tax angle better, but to me it does not seem to make sense to take a reduced social security benefit, be taxed on 85% of the amount received, and invest the net proceeds at 1/10 of 1% interest. he said, he wanted to get back every penny he contributed. fair enough, but isn't that an overly conservative strategy? besides, don't most people get back all of their contributions in three years?"
"July 22, 2014  6:27PM",laurasdada," thanks, mr. shift and henry!  guess i'll have to start considering a costco membership..."
"July 22, 2014  7:23PM",graphicguy," ld....for the savings in gas alone (and it's top tier, too), it's worth the membership.  then, you can stop being ""hoi poloi"""
"July 22, 2014  8:25PM",robr2, but driving 20 miles to the nearest costco sort of defeats the purpose...
"July 22, 2014  8:33PM",wlbrown9," i looked at my social security stuff on-line just now.  if i retire next year at 64 and start drawing, it will take about 4.5 years for me to get back my contribution. it will take about another 4.9 years to get back my employer contribution.  those two amount to about $222,000 so far. that does not include the $26,000 ($52,000) total that i and my employers have paid on medicare. my first payment into ss was 1963. the chart shows medicare started in 1966 so i did not pay into that for the first 3 years."
"July 22, 2014  8:41PM",driver100," that 62 chevrolet isn't even close to being the fastest production made car  0 to 60. see the top 10 (all under 3 seconds) this is what one guy said about the 64 chevrolet ss 409; this car available with 2 transmission. the muncie m20 wide ratio with 3.08 final and muncie m21/m22 close ratio with 4.11 and 4.56 final. it also has same suspension like 2 door ss version. it's enough to hit 146 mph with wide ratio and hit 0-60 mph close to 5 sec with close ratio. however, it has heavier body than the 2 door ss so it's slower than 2 door ss in acceleration. but, even you can't run into 150 mph, but this car proven faster than galaxie on drag strip due to lighter body. here is some info about the 63 ss 409 which could explain the light weight chevrolet offered the 409 with solid lifters and a single four bbl carb good for 400 bhp and a solid lifter 409 with two four barrel carbs good for a whooping 425 bhp. as if that wasn't enough, chevrolet introduced a new engine, the z-11 in mid 1963. this was a 427 cid v8 loosely based on the existing 409 but featured a smaller bore and a longer stroke. it featured angled valves and was nicknamed the ""porcupine head motor."" although it was officially rated at 430 bhp, it easily made close to 500 bhp and was an instant sucess at the drag strip. unfortunately, it was only available to factory approved customers through chevrolet's rpo (regular production option). it was usually coupled with the optional factory fitted lightweight front end - aluminum panels and bumper. you guys knew your stuff....4 seconds was off and there are faster car.  maybe that was the fastest production car in 1964."
"July 22, 2014  9:04PM",laurasdada," actualamente, there's a costco right around the corner from me, and they're in the process of putting in a gas station.  hmmm, wonder if they're hiring!?  my fave job of my long, lost youth?  pumping gas!  favorite parts  got a $.10 commission for every quart of oil i sold!  and, regular tips from linda blair. least favorite part?  the regular customer whose austin marina i had to spoon feed gas.  in february.  in new england."

"July 22, 2014 10:00PM",driver100," should be a fun night.....spending her money. that does sound like a fun evening.  one friend i meet for coffee during the week was telling me  the 2015 gennesis has about every option available.  if you stand behind it for a few seconds the trunk will open.  when you walk away it closes.  huge double sunroof.  beautiful 2 color leather seat with beautiful stitching.  comparable to my 535 with way more options for $20000 less.  thats over 300 hp, and the v8 with just under 500 hp is about $10k more. next week i am going to meet him at the hyundai/genesis dealer to check it out, then go for our coffee.  he thinks it won't be long and they will spin genessis away to be on it's own.  said the 2015s don't say hyundai anymore, and they have a new wing insignia like rolls royce. gg, maybe check it out tonight too!"
"July 22, 2014 10:01PM",isellhondas," i once owned a 1964 chevrolet ss with the 400 hp 409 and a four speed. it was very fast but not that fast. and, no, 409's never had a ""light weight"" body. i loved the wonderful sounds that came from the dual glasspacks!"
"July 22, 2014 10:28PM",explorerx4, sorry for the loss of your daughter. i guess she wanted you to remember her the way you remember her. the genesis badge looks more like aston martin than rolls royce. i just put you on a quest to post more pictures. ‌
"July 22, 2014 10:49PM",robr2, further the genesis wing badge has been an option since the genesis was launched.  hyundai's original plan was to launch it as a distinct brand with it's own sales channel.  but the economic dump made them reconsider the idea.
"July 23, 2014  1:39AM",driver100," ok, here you go i did say looked like a rolls but that was wrong, should be a bentley (it was a seniors thing), personally, i think the 3 look similar."
"July 23, 2014  1:47AM",driver100," hyundai has been a brilliant company.  they started out with those garbage pony's but they never left their customers completely high and dry.  they built on their mistakes and got stronger because of them.  now they have a car comparable to the luxury leaders, with a 10 year 100k mile warranty. they were smart to wait and launch genesis on it's own...the time has come.  the car can stand on it's own now. would i buy one?  probably not, i have worked too hard and i can't buy too many more new car, i don't know if i can give up a pontiac car, or possibly a indian/british jaguar.  but, stranger things have happened."
"July 23, 2014  2:04AM",Mr_Shiftright," 2015 mercedes-benz benz c class isn't even in the showrooms yet, so that's not a player. i think the 2015 c class is a much better value than the e class, from what i can see so far."

"July 23, 2014  2:30PM",laurasdada," costco membership around here is $55 base, $110 exec w/2% cash back.  i'd probably do base, can't imagine i'll recap the extra $55 in cash back.  looking forward to the gas station coming online, checking out the prices.  unless the 2% includes gas purchases?  xf is actually doing pretty well on mpg, given it's power/weight, i've been averaging over 23mpg over the last 4500 miles, per the obc."
"July 23, 2014  4:43PM",bwia," if you live in the greater boston area, get yourself a stop &amp; shop card and nix the costco idea. with the stop &amp; shop card (which is free) you accumulate points that can be used to buy shell or stop &amp; shop brand gas. i believe the lowest discount is 5 cents per gallon, but i typically get $1.20 off a gallon and the last time i filled up i got $2.40 off a gallon of shell v-power. there is only one catch, you are limited to 35 gallons per fill-up. no worries for me as my gas tank capacity is 18.5 gallons."
"July 23, 2014  5:01PM",driver100, i must have missed something.  you get $1.20 off per gallon...so gas costs just over $2 a gallon with the card?
"July 23, 2014  5:04PM",laurasdada," bwia, wow, you must really stop!  and shop!  indeed, i am in your neighborhood (boston) and have a s&amp;s card.  but, given my situation, not a lot of points accumulating, the most i've gotten is .10/gallon off pug.  the stations i use are less expenseve or equal to s&amp;s with the discount. won't make a costco decision until i see the actual pricing.  but, i wandered over to costco last night, just to check out the store.  and, had dinner!  $1.50 for a big dog and unlimited fountain drink!  i actually had the turkey sandwich/soda.  might try the pizza tonight, see how it compares to papa ginos. but, heading to la tomorrow, so all my bags are packed, i'm ready to go.  leavin' on a jet plane."
"July 23, 2014  5:38PM",bwia," yes, $1.20 and more off a gallon. honestly, i don't know how they can justify and sustain this arrangement with shell, but hey, i am not complaining."
"July 23, 2014  8:49PM",graphicguy," so, got a car buying store for everyone. my older sister had a jag s type. bought it new. it served her well.  reliable.  relatively cheap to own and operate.  i think it's 12 years old?  i know she has in excess of 150k miles on it.  don't know much about the particulars given it didn't enter into the deal (she's giving it to her college aged son). know that her little brother knows more about car than she does (and her husband is a lay down), i got the call to assist. we started out with her top 3 brands.....mercedes-benz benz, bmw and jaguar.  i forced her to look at the acura acura.  funny thing, she really liked the test drive of the acura.  price was right, too (mid $40s, loaded up).  where the germans do a better job is ""portraying"" their car as somehow superior.  great marketing. anyway, the acura was immediately dismissed, much to my chagrin. jaguar was next to fall.  she didn't like the xf or the xj, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was how they were now about 2x in price what she paid for her s type. so, bmw and mercedes-benz benz made the final list.  bmw first.....we drove a 435ix, which i loved (mineral grey with red leather).  she hated it....she said it looked like a toyota celica from the 80s.  please forgive her, she knows not of what she speaks....i'm sending her to remedial training to rectify. then it was onto a bmwx....loaded up.....$50k+  i was as surprised as she was that a bmwx could be loaded up that much.  still, i knew i could get ""my guy"" to work a nice deal....get it somewhere around $45-$46.  like me, she didn't like the crude ""start/stop"" feature with bmw, but as i told her, it's easily defeated. she spied a 320ix, which she liked as well, a bit shy of $40k....could be bought for mid $30s i'm thinking.  for her, she didn't need, nor want the extra oomph.  but, she likes her car like she likes her men.....loaded.  it didn't quite tick all the boxes on that account. last, but not least, mercedes-benz benz.  she was immediately drawn to the cla.  gotta say, it's a sexy beast.  but, i'd prefer the suspension in an f!50 that i would in that car.  plus, you can tell where the cost cutting happened.....inside and underneath.  even for a ""non-sports"" driver like her, it was noticeable.  plus, you're not going to get a discount on one of those.  dealers don't have many and they're getting msrp for the ones they do have.  high $30s to $40k seemed the norm.  the 320i is a better car for the same money......in every respect (except looks). she drove the e but was not all that enthused by the styling.  i have to admit, i liked the previous gem's styling over the new one, too.  plus, it drives like a big car.  not sure i can put my finger on it as it handled fine and it responded well.  it just felt.....well......like it was made for ""older"" people (no offense to older people here, which to my knowledge, there are none). having said that, she off handedly asked to drive the c class.  i assured her it was the same as the e, just a big smaller.  sales lady came around with a loaded c 300 4matic.  my sister fell in love with it.  hard to figure why, since she didn't like the cla nor the e.  the c struck a chord with her.  two problem.  first, color.  she wanted black with tan interior (and no fake leather).  then, there was the fact i did not prepare an offer on a c class (just the e and the cla). requesting use of the dealership's wifi while the sales lady tried to locate the exact car my sister wanted, i did a hasty offer sheet.  you guys know me....one price.  i quickly figured $2,000 under invoice (guessing that there's some sort of trunk money on it given the '15 is a redesign).  figured taxes, tags, no doc fee included added to the purchase price....voila...my number. i explained my number to the sales lady, how it was an all inclusive number, it was a one time only number, if she could find the car, we put a deposit down tonight. it took about 20 minutes for them to find the car (in chicago, but we are dealing in indianapolis, where my sister resides.  it was found.  sales manager came out to greet us, asking if we were ready to buy right now.  we were. handshake, deal was done. my sister is leaving on vacation tomorrow and they won't have the car until friday.  so, she'll pick it up then.  she left them with 10 benjamins and said she'd pick up the car when she returns.  if they don't have the car by then, the benjamins get returned. everyone's happy!"
"July 23, 2014  9:08PM",driver100," handshake, deal was done. great story gg with a happy ending for everyone.  it sounds like sis got the best car possible for her.  like i say, my friend was knocked out by the 2015 genesis....every option known to man and beautiful stitched leather upholstry for under $50k.-that's with 300+ hp.  about $60k for just under 500 hp.  but sis like me wants the real thing, not the copy cat car.  you only get one chance at this life game so may as well do it the way you want. you did very well and sis should be plaeased."

"July 23, 2014  9:39PM",verdugo," time to register my periodic complaint about the new software. it doesn't remember the last post i read like the old softtware. instead it remembers the last post when i last logged in. so unless i read all the accumulated unread messages before i log off, i will miss some. can some of the mods please talk to the vendor? this is a very stupid design decision. thank you."
"July 23, 2014  9:41PM",explorerx4," i knew you would genesis badge mystery. my wife has a stop &amp; shop card. she fills up her car and one of the kids' car to get the most out of the discount. notice, never my car."
"July 23, 2014 10:08PM",oldfarmer50," there's also the catch with any ""card"" that the retailer can track your purchases and sell the data to marketers who then send you lots of crap based on your profile.  not to mention telemarketers."
"July 23, 2014 10:21PM",graphicguy," driver...thanks.  my sister's happy.  that's all that matters.  plus, she took me out to dinner at a pretty nice place for my efforts, which is a lot more than i've received from helping others buy a car. my sister's a brand buyer.  if the brand is associated with luxury, regardless of how good or bad the product is, it's on her short list.  the 6 cal c 300 isn't all that bad.  i think a bmwx trumps it, an acura blows it our of the water when it comes to features/performance and bang for the buck.  but, i got the impression she was leaning towards the mercedes-benz benz all along. as such, rightfully or wrongfully, i wouldn't have been able to get her into the hyundai store.  now, if it were an upscale separate showroom (like acura, infiniti, lexus)?  maybe.  maybe if it were called luxo limo instead of hyundai, perhaps. q....sorry 'bout that.  volvo didn't even make her list, though."

"July 23, 2014 11:49PM",bwia," congrats, and you can now consider yourself a veritable car broker, and for troubles you should have asked for a referral fee. recently, when my wife bought her buick buick i jokingly asked the dealership for a referral fee. to my surprise they sent me a $100 visa cash card. btw, was your sister mildly interested in an upscale suv? i had mentioned the range rover evoque when you were soliciting ideas but i guess an suv was not on her radar. they position themselves as the ""ultimate in luxury and performance."""
"July 24, 2014 12:01AM",oldfarmer50," ""...to my surprise they sent me a $100 visa cash card..."" i think they call that a ""bird dog"".  when i bought my eclipse i mentioned the name of a woman at work who had purchased at the same store. her salesman promised a spiff for each referral. as far as i know the promised spiff turned out to be a stiff. they never paid."
"July 24, 2014 12:51AM",roadburner, two sales stories! my son needed a bike for school and my wife and i wanted to start riding again. turns out there's a small shop in louisville that specializes in rebuilding and repairing used bikes a very nice young man owns it; he helped my son pick out a diamondback voyager while my wife decided on a giant cypress. with a helmet and bike lock we spent less than $600. the shop is currently restoring my 1973 raleigh pontiac- even in my early teens i was looking across the pond
"July 24, 2014 12:56AM",imidazol97," funny thing, she really liked the test drive of the acura.  price was right, too (mid $40s, loaded up).  where the germans do a better job is ""portraying"" their car as somehow superior.  great marketing. good job gg. well told with a lot of perception about the forces in a person's car-buying, or even their car-shopping motivations."
"July 24, 2014  1:40AM",imidazol97," and they gave chevrolet top spot. i was surprised they gave the volkswagen a mild discussion. the car is liked by so many people in many variations from diesel turbo to plain. i did more reading after your post while i was on vacation. i compared more of the articles. i think the people doing the reading of the other reviews and ""test drives"" aren't as astute at picking out the fakes and the talkers from the folks actually driving car the way most of us would drive them. i suggest the motorweek method is wrong where the more they can squeal the tires on takeoff the happier they are with the car. the faster in the quarter mile the better they like it. they heavily rely on their expectations of a racing car rather than on the reality of use from the reports at motorweek. they slant their evaluations such as the braking. i've seen car they bragged on stopping in 128 feet with twitches in the car as ""great"" while car from companies they like less which stop in 120 feet are ""okay."" only good thing i saw on motorweek was that they had two women, one of their own who gives reportss and one from edmunds iirc, evaluate vehicles. i was amazed at how well they explained what they liked and didn't like, from a mother or taxi-mother's value system about certain car. no squealing tires and acting as if every car should be a race car in order to be useful."
"July 24, 2014  1:56AM",driver100," i don't usually bet but i had a feeling the mercedes-benz benz would win.  my friend who told me about the genesis and how impressive it was, said, one problem they do have is you have people in the same showroom with little kids and they are filling up on hot dogs and donuts and free drinks.  probably not nice to mention it, but, it isn't the best atmosphere for pushing a luxo car."
"July 24, 2014  2:03AM",driver100, good synopsis of reviews.  good reviews are hard to find.  i find newspapers give information that is too positive....guess they worry about ad revenue.  some magazines review high end car most people can never afford.  some like consumers report are big on practicality when practically may not matter to the buyer.  the best we can do is sift through the information and try to see what car suits are needs the best.
"July 24, 2014  9:35AM",oldfarmer50, on car reviews i don't how you can review a sports car and a minivan by the same criteria.  sure both should have good brakes but from there everything is different.  the priority for the sports car would be performance while the mini van buyer would be looking at practicality.
"July 24, 2014 11:42AM",bwia," oh, oh in the latest round of recalls announced yesterday, my buick buick is on that list for a bolt problem in the driver's seat. they caution that owners should refrain from raising the seat until the problem is remedied."
"July 24, 2014 12:02PM",ray80," i believe our gmc terrain  may be on list for same issue, we shall see."
"July 24, 2014 12:09PM",imidazol97," gm is being exceedingly thorough in addressing any slight flaws now. my '14 chevrolet had a trivial recall for a software update for the hydraulic brake assist. while there i visited the showroom to see how much of a safety threat the chevrolet's ignition key recall is to the roadways. i sat in the driver seat and found it would be next to impossible for me to bump the switchblade key fob to twist it in the correct direction to move the switch from run to acc. i haven't heard of lots of problem there since the chevrolet came out, but there have, apparently, been a few reports of that having occurred. it certainly makes me feel safer to know the items that normally would not have been recalls are being taken care of. now we need to ask why the other companies aren't doing thorough recalls as is gm. we have to wonder how many hidden dangers lie in those vehicles while the drivers think they are safe."
"July 24, 2014 12:12PM",imidazol97," that's very true. but the folks testing at the magazines grew up on foreign brands during the period of malaise for some of the us brands. they will first be more partial to those with which they are familiar. second, they tend to think everyone is a race care driver. that's why i was so impressed with the two women doing a comparison of some vehicles on motorweek several shows back. of course, it had been set up in a chauvinistic manner in that they were looking for vehicles for a family's use rather than for general drivers and family considered as well. but they were evaluating car on the bases that the other 99% of buyers would have for a purchase. i believe the buick buick was one of their likes. i'll try to find that video if it's on motorweek's site. edit this is not the clip i saw on my tape of a motorweek show, but i'll bet it fomented the idea of having a composite of this with some of the show's own clips of two ladies showing what they liked. yolanda vazquez of motorweek caroll lachnit of edmunds.com if you watch the clip, notice the pc and the chauvenism. they didn't have the ladies testing regular bmw's for their feedback, nor regular sedan of any brand. or did i miss that in the vidvolkswagen?"
"July 24, 2014 12:54PM",robr2," the problem with that progdodge is that you have to spend 20% more to buy groceries at stop &amp; shop instead of market basket where i go.  but with the family squabble there, i have been forced to use s&amp;s and shaw's. the $2.40 a gallon is great but that means you spent $2400 on groceries in the past 30 days!!  the max is actually $2.20 and you earn $0.10 per gallon off with $100 in purchases.  still means your family spent $2200 at s&amp;s in 30 days.  your max savings is $77 at the pump when you do so. if it works for you, great.  since i have market basket nearby, i prefer the 4% discount on groceries they are giving this year as well as the lower everyday prices they have."
"July 24, 2014  1:01PM",ab348, exactly.

"July 24, 2014  2:01PM",driver100," that statement sounds like a classic case of turning a bad thing into a good thing.  gm is being extra careful so is a safer company....the other car companies don't have as many recalls because they don't care.  maybe it is because the other companies build their car with more care.  maybe they haven't allowed shody workmanship to creep into the culture. i have a feeling gm isn't just being overly cautious, this is do or die for them.  they can't get away with pushing recalls under the rug. some of the recalls are trivial, but many show sloppy attention to detail. the automaker is recalling more than 822,000 car worldwide for a variety of issues, including problem with seat, air bags and turn signals, parts that may not have been welded together properly, and a loss of power steering. some of the car in the latest recall have already been recalled multiple times for other problem. the 2014 chevrolet chevrolet, for instance, was identified in february as having a defective transmission shift cable adjuster, which could cause the car to roll away after the vehicle was parked. in june, it was recalled again because the ignition could shut off while the car was in motion, cutting power to the engine and causing the air bags to fail. g.m. recalled more than 65,000 chevrolets on wednesday for a loss of power steering, and it tied the defect to one crash but no injuries. the company also recalled more than 475,000 car — including models of the chevrolet chevrolet and chevrolet; gmc terrain; buick buick and buick; and the cadillac cadillac — because of a defect that allows the front and passenger seat to move up and down freely because of a loose bolt. g.m. said it was aware of one crash and three injuries related to this condition. it added that the car was safe to drive, but that customers should not use the power height adjuster until the car had been fixed. do i want to not drive my car because a bolt has to be replaced in the seat?  there are so many other brands to choose from, do i need this kind of problem?  the recall problem at gm is out of control, and i doubt it is because gm is the only company looking into problem....because they care."
"July 24, 2014  2:07PM",bwia," i watched that motorweek episode, and as a matter of fact i recorded it. i believe the theme of the show was what women want in a car. with that in mind i don't think it had a chauvinistic slant.they felt that the buick buick matched their tastes and desires and as a result their top pick. in the end it felt like an infomercial for the buick though."
"July 24, 2014  2:20PM",bwia," still safer than flying. two air disasters in two days? 116 souls perished today when an algerian airline crashed. yesterday, 48 lost their lives when a flight from taiwan crashed due to severe weather conditions. i know it is still safer to fly than drive but these recent airline disasters are unsettling."
"July 24, 2014  2:37PM",oldfarmer50, are you planning a trip to mali or malaysia soon?
"July 24, 2014  2:48PM",stickguy, everything on motor week cones across as an infomercial.
"July 24, 2014  3:00PM",rbirns1," how many people died in car crashes the past two days?  guarantee it was way more than died in those plane crashes.  there is no comparison.  passenger air travel is way safer.  only difference is every crash makes the news, unlike car."
"July 24, 2014  3:24PM",driver100," not arguing, but i once read an article that said car travel was safer, if you consider exposure time.  plane travel covers many miles for a much shorter period of time.  the article said car travel was safer if you only consider the time you are exposed. might be another, statistics can say what you want them to say. i also wonder, at least you can do somethings to defend yourself in a car.  hard to be defensive when you are a passenger on a plane that is blasted out of the sky by madmen."
"July 24, 2014  3:33PM",imidazol97," so it was the buick they picked in one category! in the heels and wheels story i linked they picked the envoy iirc. i'll give you that i'm a little picky about the chauvinism. but why not have the ladies do test drives of the lamborghini on motorweek? or the volkswagen they just tested? what i would like to see is instead of having the testosterone-handicapped 30-year old guys test driving the various hellcats and other high horsepower and high performance vehicles, let's let the ladies  who are car oriented pick which vehicles to test drive and drives ones that more of us are likely to be interested in buying. i would like to see the bmw models critiqued by someone who is not interested in racing as their sole driving mode. same for the many others on motorweek or in the car mags. maybe they could test drive the buick buick which just came in 1 point behind a bmw model in the testing by cr of premium small car, tying the c250. cts and ats were also near behind; 84, 83, 83, and 76/76. but we won't see that touted around the internet by the car mags or motorweek. and of course, the ""testers,"" evaluators, or whatever they're called can't resist putting in the usual dig about buick, ""“the buick is a thoroughly developed and satisfying mid-sized sports sedan that’s more reminiscent of a german sports car than the** softly sprung luxo-barges that buick was once known for,**” jake fisher, consumer reports’ director of automotive testing, said in a statement."" at least they put in ""once known for."" that's an example of what needs to be rethrough by people perpetuating stereotypes. my 98 lesabre was very comfortable for driving to williamsburg. and it cornered surprising well with a rear stabilizer bar and monroe struts. my 03 was even better equipped from the factory and had a much different feel to the ride, although still comfortable. then when i put on monroe replacement struts and shocks, it was too hard for 5000 miles or so until they softened a little. this is why i think was need to get more typical people doing test drives and get them actually into the car rather than just repeating what they think a car is like and reporting from the publicity sheet from the manufacturer. just my opinion."
"July 24, 2014  3:51PM",dino001," i don't think it's just time.  it's probably also a distance, as long as it is above certain threshold.  there is no doubt in my mind that ten round trips from atlanta to boston are much safer on plane than by car.  however, this may not be exactly same equation when you take some short plane trip (say atlanta to jacksonville, florida) vs. short distance-low speed equivalent of local trips, at least in terms of probability of death.  in other words, it may be more probable to get injured on a number of trips to a grocery store than 250-mile trip by plane, but less probable to die. statistics can be massaged, or twisted to show desired predetermined conclusion. human fear of flying is a survival response to an unnatural act, such as getting into a metal (or now even plastic) box in uncomfortable proximity to other people, rising to 30 thousand feet at incomprehensible speed, trusting some unknown individual whose face we often haven't seen to get us where we want and afterwards getting on with you life in far away place, often at different time of day than that perceived by our body.  feel of total lack of control vs. a passable illusion of control while driving exacerbate that fear and allow us to get into car often without thinking about it. the fact that plane crash makes global news, but a bus or car crash barely registers on local footnote means we ""tamed"" fear of driving, but flying is still foreign.  it also means that it is safer, because plane crash is rare, yet car crash is every day. same thing is with natural disasters.  we often read that storm or flood ""killed x number of people"".  however, if we considered how many vehicular accidents happens in affected area on a comparable day, the headline should most likely be ""hurricane saved x number of people"", because at that time nobody was on the road."

"July 24, 2014  5:40PM",ab348," that is a ridiculous statement. how about the chrysler workers who were videoed smoking weed and drinking booze while on break? you think they don't do ""shoddy workmanship"" when they get back on the line? how about all the ford recalls on their new model introductions? and need i mention toyota a few years ago? frankly, it's makers like hyundai, fiat, and nissan i worry about, whose car are often mentioned as having problem of various sorts, but never seem to recall any of them. gm is recalling everything that has any problem reported relating to it. it might be one  or two incidents for a given model, but they are recalling many thousands just to be sure. it gives some people an opening to bash them at will. go ahead, enjoy it while you can."
"July 24, 2014  5:43PM",verdugo, thank you kirstie
"July 24, 2014  8:18PM",driver100," i doubt if gm would be making all these recalls if they weren't caught on the ignition recall.  now, they are being extra cautious because they simply cannot afford to get caught covering up another error. most of the problem are serious ones....i mean losing steering and bags not opening can lead to deaths.  60 recalls for 28 million car in one year tells me there is a problem somewhere.  it may be in engineering, it may be parts manufacturers, it may be assembly.  i don't see large numbers of recalls from too many manufacturers - and these seem to be never ending.  of course there are going to be recalls, but, there comes a point when continual recalls mean something is not right.  i think we are passed the limit i would accept....i wouldn't take the chance buying a gm car.....i don't want to have to park it for weeks while new parts are made. if bmw had constant recalls i doubt if i would buy one until they got past the problem.  i don't want to park a car i want to use when i want to use it.  i don't have the patience or that much loyalty.  it sounds like you trust gm no matter what, and you have made the recalls sound like a good thing.  i think the recalls indicate a problem, and i am not there to support them no matter what they do."
"July 24, 2014  9:42PM",imidazol97," that statement sounds like a classic case of turning a bad thing into a good thing. gm is being extra careful so is a safer company....the other car companies don't have as many recalls because they don't care. that's your opinion and i certainly wouldn't attack anyone for chevroleting their own opinion. you can only hope, because you likely have no idea how many small things exist. in gm's case an employee and few others made a terrible decision scientifically because the ignition shutting off turns off the air bags. the car still can be steered but is harder to turn. brakes still work. as to the switchblade keyfob, i recall my friend's volkswagen and volkswagen having that same system. i wonder if those in the volkswagen/audi are susceptible to bumping by a knee and moving enough to turn off the on power. i recall some honda having problem with customers complaining the airbags didn't go off. i see a current recall for nissan about airbags. maybe we need to start doing further research on other companies and their recalls or non recalls. remember toyota resisted classifying the acceleration problem as other than short duration with the nhsta therefore the interest in their true threat didn't come until more publicity. again i see gm's handling as a positive in a bad situation especially since there may have been deaths directly attributable to the ignition switches. as for for the others, many of the recalls are to check items and in some cases the recalls are for only a few vehicles within the set of vehicles identified because the recall involves certain options. as for the bolt in the seat, you know more than i do on that one. i haven't researched to see just what is involved."
"July 24, 2014  9:51PM",imidazol97," my neighbor is a shadetree mechanic supreme. he solicits and does work on many ""premium"" vehicles including mercedes-benz benz and bmw. it's amazing what engineering exists in the bmw that is problematic. then the owners don't want to pay for it outside the 4-year service warranty, so they look for the shortcuts. mercedes-benz benz has quality engineering in their parts by comparison. as one member of our discussion said recently, one car company has nurtured their image very well. i would just some car company's images to be not quite earned, but rather advertised. lots of bmw around here were bought or leased based on advertising for the image people perceived, but then by the end of the full service warranty those puppies have been traded for something else. it's all in the image. and just as in politics a lot of smearing goes on because it's chic to smear certain people or groups. that's why i started pointing out gm has a whole different history than a foreign company does which moved into a niche with  product us makers and their uaw workers as chains-around-their-necks didn't fulfill. gm has many changed products and i think it's only fair to consider those rather than stereotype them. however, the last few decades the evaluation is to look for one thing that a gm product didn't have that the other person's favorite vehicle did, and then that was the end of a fair consideration. i recall when honda had a 5-speed transmission and gm had 4-speed transmission. lots of smearing because of the 4-speed (mine works very well in my lesabres, thank you for asking). but then gm came out 6-speed transmissions and all of a sudden honda folks didn't think 6-speed was anything better than 5-speeds. but to each his own opinion. i certainly wouldn't attack someone over it. i can disagree with it and make points, however. further, i'm not here pointing out a list of recalls or service bulletins for other vehicles to downgrade their efforts. i'm sure no one wants gm &amp; toyota to have problem especially of the type where deaths occur."
"July 24, 2014 10:09PM",abacomike,
"July 24, 2014 10:58PM",imidazol97," the size of gm compared to the us sales of some other companies means a lot more car involved in a recall like this. also, with many brands if they can keep the car coming back to them for service they can handle ""problem"" with tsbs and silent recalls. i remember a coworker talking about his toyota in the 90s where it was in for warranty work for bad brakes on the rear and he went back to his car and they had the top of the engine off doing something to the engine as well. he was only told about the brakes which wore out fast, faster than the fronts. this was in the late 90s. of course, with many people, they never knew that some flaw had been repaired besides the brakes, so they felt their car was just perfect--never had any problem."
"July 24, 2014 11:39PM",dino001," nobody prohibited gm do just what you described, they chose to ignore problem, blame and ridicule their customers when they reported issues, never volunteer to fix problem announced or not, and act only when there was no other choice.  yeah, those poor abused honda or toyota customers, evil japanese fixed their car and didn't tell them.  gm way, i.e. not doing anything, is sooo much better."
"July 25, 2014  2:05AM",driver100," imid, let me start by saying i enjoy your posts, you put a lot of thought into your answers and you come up with some good info.  but, just some comments at random; that's like hearsay evidence.  one persons comments don't matter too much.  i have spoken to many people who once owned gm car, now they own asian or euro car and they will never go back.  they weren't treated well in the past, and they have found there is a new game in town. some people buy a bmw because of the image it conveys.  maybe success, good taste, like refinement, appreciate superb engineering, etc.  i buy one because i am never disappointed, i know the car will be fun to drive, i know it has been engineered to the max, i know it will retain it's value because people know they are good well made car, i know it will be designed right and it will have the latest safety devices....no short cuts, no trying to get a car made for a certain price, and having to take short cuts to get to that price.  i don't want to compromise on safety over a few bucks. i have a pretty open mind about car brands.  gm may have changed, i am sure they have, they have to, but, i can only go by recent performance.  i am not going to be the guinee pig who tries one to see if they really have changed.  i am not tied to any one brand, but, i know all my bmw, 4 of them, performed perfectly.  i think one of them had a recall done.  others may have been done during service but that is even better like dino said.  no down time. it's easy to say you have learned from your mistakes and things will be better going forward.  to me, words don't mean much....it's action and results.  i hope gm does overcome these recalls, and the numbers are way higher in comparison to any other car company, but, i am not ready to buy yet.  if i am 100% satisfied with my bmw, and it runs fine, why would i change for a car that has a questionable recall record?"
"July 25, 2014  2:14AM",driver100," i agree...i don't want to take the chance of my car being tied up with recalls.  i heard one woman on the radio who had a saturn in for a new ignition.  it has been 6 weeks and the dealer gave her a loaner car, a dodge.  she said she likes the dodge and will possibly buy one next time. i agree with your comments and understand why you would not buy another bmw.  we had a 1995 volvo that had numerous problem, and i doubt i would buy another volvo.  like i say, i am not overly loyal to any car company, but, i do demand certain standards, i know i will probably feel good about a bmw, mercedes-benz benz, audi and possibly jaguar.  i just wouldn't take a chance on gm.  i think they will get through this, but, i don't want to be taking a car in for recalls all the time.  btw....what about when the recall time is up and they tell you you are on your own now........gm has done that before too."
"July 25, 2014  2:16AM",roadburner," my problem with gm is that they only build one car i would consider owning- the c7 chevrolet. nothing else gm cranks out interests me in the slightest. i've even recommended gm products to a few friends, but the chance of me(or my family) buying one is close to zero. having said that, the same is true of almost every other brand out there except for bmw, jeep, mazda, or porsche..."
"July 25, 2014  2:17AM",driver100," perfect!  i couldn't have said it better.  you are right about being forced to make repairs too....before that they wouldn't even pay for people killed because of a failure.  well, maybe this is the new gm....am i going to be the one to risk finding out if they really have changed, i don't think so."
"July 25, 2014  4:28AM",nyccarguy, the c7 is most definitely at the top of the short list of gm car i'd own.  i'd also add the buick buick &amp; chevrolet chevrolet diesel to that list.
"July 25, 2014 11:35AM",driver100," just curious.  why would you consider those brands but not say, mercedes-benz benz, audi, (comparable to bmw) nissan, honda, (comparable to mazda)?  hmm, nothing quite comparable to jeep or porche i suppose."
"July 25, 2014 12:02PM",bwia," sorry i cannot add to the anti-gm debate except to say that perhaps we should have more of an open mind with respect to gm products. whether one buys a german marque or a domestic brand is a choice one makes to differentiate his social class. and of course one pays dearly for that distinction. gm is the #1 domestic auto maker for a reason. its products are beautifully styled, practical and reliable. (yes reliable!) while its unfortunate that some deaths have been attributed to poor design or defective parts it not fair, however, to throw the baby out with the bath water. in addressing these problem gm has taken a comprehensive approach to safety by recalling vehicles for every minor issue, regardless of cost, that now runs into the billions of dollars. by doing so it is trying to reassure the public that gm's products are safe and the company will stand behind its promises, implied or chevroleted. that is a responsible thing to do and the company should be applauded for its efforts rather be derided as some have chosen to do. c'est tout"
"July 25, 2014 12:37PM",ray80," got a letter in the mail the other day from jeep dealer. pretty much the usual thing, my gmc could be worth $$$$ towards trade in.  couldn't help but notice (because it was in very red background color) the box in upper right asking if i was tired  of gm recalls.   timing of mailer could have been a tad better as it came the same day the newest jeep recall was announced (for switchs that could be bumped, knocking it out of run position and disabling power steering,brakes and air-bags).   hope they didn't waste to much money on that one"
"July 25, 2014 12:39PM",dino001," that's true, but the reason may be much more complex than you would like to admit.  in germany, volkswagen is no. 1 domestic market company, in france it is renault, in japan it is toyota, in korea it is hyundai, etc.  i don't think any of those cases have much to do with true superiority of the product, it is rather a mix of incumbency, pricing, cost, government intervention (customs, regulations) and some national(istic) pride.  this includes gm. strip gm from its fleet sales (rental and especially companies from industries compelled by buy america clause) and how do their sales look then?  perhaps it's not fair to exclude those fleet sales completely, but it is fair to put asterisk on them, because factors going into fleet decisions are different than individual's - mostly it has to do with spending somebody else's money, also with government regulation. i actually agree with you on something - their product is probably best it has ever been, in many cases it became comparable to its foreign competition (partially due honda/toyota lowering the bar, imho).  all i can say to them keep going and you'll be rewarded.  however, it is not reasonable to expect for people to change their minds on a dime, just because the product is better.  this is a process.  it was 30 years of continuous ""effort"" on gm part to squander so much of good will, the full recovery time is probably going to be equally long, if not longer.  they have to win customers one at a time.  btw, i have similar problem with gm to roadburner - there simply isn't much there that i find appealing to own.  i don't think their car are ""crap"" or anything, i simply don't like big, bulky vehicles with huge chrome grills.  i wouldn't mind to get ats, cts, or chevrolet, chevrolet as a rental, but i simply have no interest of putting a vehicle like that in my garage.  last gm vehicle that i was really (potentially) interested to own was saab 9-3 aero, version with hatch.  i also like the idea of cts, but it's a bit bulky and wagon was auto only, unless you got cts-v, which was too expensive and would have real world gas mileage below 20 mpg. i didn't get my bmw because of ""badge"", ""prestige"", or any of that stuff, could care less.  i got it because it was the only rwd wagon/hatchback with manual transmission, six-cylinder engine and sport suspension offered at price that i was willing to pay.  subaru, which i used to own, was no longer interested in building a car like that.  they had subaru, but i ""graduated"" to something more refined, but legacy is no longer a product it used to be.  audi decided to can that line and sell a nicer outback instead (allroad).  mercedes-benz benz withdrew completely, saab went bankrupt.  volvo also missed on couple of points.  none of domestics offered anything close, japanese were not interested, either.  it really was bmw or nothing.  today even they don't have manual with hatch anymore. btw, i find it really interesting that many gm aficionados always cry for ""open mind"" when it comes to their favorite brand, but in next sentence assign all evil to the competitions.  basically they want to have it both ways."
"July 25, 2014 12:46PM",ab348," now , we cannot have that kind of attitude here! you'll be drummed out of the group for not jumping on the gm-basher bandwagon if you keep it up with these rational posts. for those who claim that gm makes nothing that interest them, you know what? most manufacturers are like that for me. chrysler? nothing. ford? same. toyota, nissan, mazda? same. hyundai-kia? no way. m-b? love them, but not willing to pay that kind of money. bmw? love them too (or at least some) but the image and the ongoing and expensive service issues that are well-described here make it a headache i don't want to deal with. all manufacturers have their issues. let's just recognize what is going on here with gm right now and move on."
"July 25, 2014 12:58PM",dino001," this is true.  however, one plane goes down in africa or ukraine and it is news everywhere.  how many people die worldwide in car crashes in same time between each of those plane crashes?  what is a ""density"" of that, i.e. comparable incident rate vs. some metric that could chevrolet real probability? regarding hurricanes ""killing"" vs. ""saving"", i'm not convinced - it may be true, but a typical event has a radius of hundreds of miles.  when it passes through, there is nobody on streets in vast areas for hours, vs. bustling traffic on a comparable day.  it would be really interesting to see real statistics about that. psychologists discovered long time ago that humans are very selective in their fears, i.e. their responses are non-linear in nature.  something very rare (and unlikely) but terrible occupies our mind and triggers fears in completely disproportional manner to something that's much more frequent (and likely).  fearing a plane and having no second thoughts about a car ride is completely irrational, but this is the way we respond.  insurance companies discovered that long time ago, hence their businesses are so successful."
"July 25, 2014  1:06PM",driver100," dino, you get down to the nitty gritty.  european car have a very different style...you can experience it with art (mona lisa) and with food (italian food), movies (no adam sandler type movies) and in architecture etc.  not saying better, just different.  some might say more refined, more elegant, very sensible.  interiors are generally elegant but not overdone.  there is a difference.   i would find it hard to buy a big bulky chrome cladded car as well.  of course not all american car are that way, but many of them are. the gm fans always throw this ""badge/prestige/image"" thing out there.......it can only be because they have never driven a european car to know there is a difference.  once you experience the fun to drive feeling, the steering and handling, the right ergonomics, the engineering put into a european car you will know it isn't just an image thing.  the car is engineered by people who love car and know how they should feel....not produced by a corporate conglomerate with committees and bean counters trying to produce a product for a particdular price."
"July 25, 2014  1:25PM",qbrozen, can't say i understand the gm bashing based on recalls. recalls don't bother me one iota. i bash gm because the large majority of their car are just dismal. they offer absolutely nothing that interests me. the upcoming colorado diesel is the only thing that comes to mind.
"July 25, 2014  1:31PM",dino001," i think bashing here is mostly not because gm is recalling car now, it is that that did not recall them when they should have."
"July 25, 2014  2:07PM",dino001," exactly.  best example would be recent cadillac commercial, which for me is a perfect repellant.  it features, what i can only describe as ""slave masters of the past"" (some egyptian pharao on a carrier, some indian maharaja on an elephant and a french queen from louis xiv time in a coach) and then shot of happy people in an cadillac coming to some resort, having their bags picked up.  if there was an award for most tasteless and disgusting commercial ever, this one would probably be a frontrunner for me.  buy a cadillac, you'll join most horrible oppressors this planet has seen*. *slaves sold separately. essentially, gm is selling version of luxury that i find lacking of basic taste.  everything in your face to the point of grotesque."
"July 25, 2014  2:36PM",Mr_Shiftright," i think the best way to judge a car company is to let buyers decide the issue by voting with their wallets. if buyers suzukike a product, then that company has done something wrong; if the company prospers, it's hard to argue that there's a not a good reason for it---it might not be the best product, but something---marketing, price, image, whatever--keeps it going."
"July 25, 2014  2:42PM",graphicguy," my gm experiences have been documented here. i still think anyone who really wants to get a good inside look at gm (and a great education regarding big business), should read bob lutz's book.  he pretty mush spells out what we all think.  that is, gm is a company that is way too focused on archaic processes and policies, while giving too much power to the accountants and lawyers.  can't argue that given those were some of the first firings done after the ignition debacle.  the lawyers because they took the stance of ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" and threatening their customer base with legal action of their own. the accountants because in an effort to cut every last penny out of a part (ignition switch) they had their engineering team design, it caused harm and even death. lutz told a story about how what is now the ""cue"" system in the cadillac came to be.  someone came up with the brilliant idea that no one wanted to use buttons anymore....especially some of the older clients that cadillac was so afraid to lose.  the result?  an ill conceived touch sensitive series of sliders (that turn out to be not so touch sensitive because of the cost cutting) that practically no one likes. i do believe gm is trying to right itself, yet again.  they do have some good (not great) products.  the afore mentioned cadillacs and chevrolets being just two.  i like their big trucks and suvs.  owned a tahoe at one point, which was one of the best vehicles i ever owned.  but, my mother also owned one of the worst vehicles i've ever seen any car company produce (sts). i don't know how many more chances the public should give them.  many times, gm doesn't even ask for forgiveness, when they most certainly should. i know for a while there. some were calling them ""government motors"".  i think it's time for the government to either hold their feet to the fire, or let the law suits fly, eating away at them until there's nothing left.  maybe the point will be made then....change or die."
"July 25, 2014  2:51PM",dino001," i didn't read lutz's book.  i hope he took some responsibility himself, as he was one of those spineless managers running the company at the time."

"July 25, 2014  4:03PM",Mr_Shiftright," well the company has no choice but that one. no one is ever going to make the perfect car right out of the box. i mean, other automakers have gotten away with things that are borderline scandalous....what about subaru's defective head gaskets on their 2.5l engines---they just told owners to stuff it---and porsche's defective ims bearings that destroyed many a low mileage engine on the 996 and the boxster. precious few owners ever got compensated for those defects, unless under warranty."
"July 25, 2014  4:22PM",driver100," *slaves sold separately. lol....i almost fell out of my chair with that remark.  the cadillac is one car that has a little too much ""bling"" for my taste.  i have to say, when i saw that ad i wondered what the h--- is going on!!!!!"
"July 25, 2014  4:25PM",driver100," mistakes do happen, but, those mistakes didn't cost lives over a $1 part, and then lead to a cover up.  i believe it was on 60 minutes that one former gm exec said, there is no way one person could order a change for a part and then not get the part number changed.  it sounds logical to me...how does one person do all that in a huge corporation.  they probably paid him a $million to take the blame."
"July 25, 2014  4:33PM",oldfarmer50," gm and other car companies have tried to weasel out of paying for any number of defects.  off hand i can think of gm's northstar head gasket issue, the 3.8l intake manifold gasket (that cost me $600).  then there were the sluging engines from chrysler, honda and toyota of the early 2000s. can't think of too many from ford since the exploding pinto unless you include the exploding firestone tires."
"July 25, 2014  4:40PM",ab348," so when subaru sells engines that fail prematurely for years and years and takes no responsibility on behalf of the people who bought them, that's a ""mistakes do happen"" scenario? maybe the reason is that if they did a bunch of execs at fuji would literally have to fall on their swords. this discussion is spiraling down to a point where i'm going to say something that gets me banned soon if i continue to engage with some of the bashers here, so i better shut myself up. maybe the mods should change the title of the discussion to ""gm bashers r us - meet here"". this is ridiculous."
"July 25, 2014  5:23PM",dino001," i don't know about subaru's problem and attitudes.  i heard something about honda's transmissions, or toyota's sludge.  i bet every company has something of what they aren't proud.  the difference is frequency.  also, it seems that those other brand fans are often ready to acknowledge those issues (perhaps underplay them somewhat), but every gm forum that i've seen invariably turns into ""and look at johny, he is ugly, too"" arguments."
"July 25, 2014  5:27PM",stever," seems like we had (or tried to start) a ""known issues"" discussion years ago. caravan transmissions, cr-v ac compressors, subaru head gaskets, new volkswagen power windows, lincoln air suspensions. there's just about something for every car (or in the case of a freelander, everything). the thing that always bugs me about the government motors slur is that chrysler is a ""two time"" loser in that regard, but takes no flack for their second bailout."
"July 25, 2014  5:55PM",abacomike," dino, i don't think ""bashing"" is the right word to describe what is happening here on this forum regarding gm.  bashing is the word used by a couple of posters who think every time gm is mentioned in a ""less-than-angelic"" light, it is <strong>  bashing </strong> !  obviously, bashing is not appropriate, in my opinion. yes, i agree the major issue with many people is the fact that gm withheld information about a known defect in a part which had caused deaths and injuries with no regard for the welfare of human beings.  that is the <strong>  key </strong> issue.  everything about what gm has done ""since"" that became known has been discussed, and discussed, and discussed. i refuse to buy a toyota, gm, or bmw product because of ""history"" with those companies.  it is a personal choice - but it is not ""bashing"" a company if i so choose not to do business with those companies because of safety issues or the manner in which they do or ""did"" business.  in toyota's case, they did the same thing gm did - withheld vital information about defects.  as for  bmw, it was a personal experience with their products that caused me to eliminate them from my ""buy"" list. yes, the major issue with toyota and gm is their business ethics - the manner in which they chose to do business by withholding information from the public. i always thought that ""bashing"" took place when you purposely denounce a person, company or organization with ""malice""!!!!  there is no malice here.  i am not filled with ""malice"" when i choose not to purchase a product.  i don't buy the product because of a personal choice. would i buy another bmw or toyota or gm product in the future (if i live long enough)?  of course i might - but it all depends upon what those manufacturers do now and in the future that will attract me to their products once again.  in other words, ""...prove to me that you are building a good, reliable and desirable product and i will consider buying your product."""
"July 25, 2014  6:03PM",dino001," agreed, mike.  i adopted the word, because wanted to be ""half way"" with the defenders.  as you know, i'm not a big fan of the brand for reasons present prior this recall wave.  however, i think there is enough evidence of a criminal cover up within that company, which means that for significant portion of the market it lost whatever remained from good will and it has an uphill battle for even a basic trust.  in other words, there may not be ""malice"" in gm criticism, but there is not much of good will, either.  in essence, gm defenders demand benefit of the doubt, which gm critics are not willing to give - for obvious reasons."
"July 25, 2014  7:51PM",driver100," bash·ing [bash-ing] show ipa noun the act of beating, whipping, or thrashing a series of unsolved bashings and robberies. a decisive defeat we gave the visiting team a good bashing. a. unprovoked physical assaults against members of a specified group gay-bashing. b. verbal abuse, as of a group or a nation feminist-bashing; china-bashing. i have no idea how any comments made were ""bashing"".  several people stated they aren't interested in buying gm car either because no models appeal to them, they don't like the way the major recalls were handled, they don't trust the company or the reliability. to say that other manufacturers have also had recalls doesn't excuse gm from any of the reasons given for not buying a gm car.  i may not buy a chrysler product because there isn't anything that appeals to me....that's not bashing chrysler.  i wouldn't buy a toyota because i don't like the way they drive, i wouldn't buy a rover because of their poor reliability, i wouldn't buy a taurus because it has a huge amount of metal and little tiny windows,  and on and on.....not bashing.  i wouldn't buy a 750 bmw because it is too big.  i doubt i would buy a gm car because i am not that inspired by what i see, but i just don't have any trust at this time.  where does the bashing come in?"
"July 25, 2014  8:17PM",robr2," i've read a couple of lutz's books.  imho, lutz is too self centered and egotistical to ever think he could make a mistake, must less admit to it."
"July 25, 2014  8:50PM",Mr_Shiftright," i agree with most of you---- beating the dead horse does seem pointless after a while. the question becomes more about where does gm go from here, and will we see a change of attitude over time? as for lutz, i didn't read his book but i heard him interviewed a couple of times, and i was rather shocked how ignorant he is when he steps out of the car world. but then, i don't know why i would expect auto execs to be renaissance men and women. i also try to keep in mind for myself that what we call ""the media"" is a filtered medium---that is, both content and delivery are chosen for us---so mere repetition can often make a problem seem worse than it is, and lack of attention can help gloss over serious issues."
"July 25, 2014  9:46PM",dino001," my (anti)favorite lutz performance was an interview with larry kudlow, when on question why gm's management didn't do anything to break union stranglehold, he said something that uaw had two months (iirc) of strike fund and gm did not.  wow....  of course, kudlow didn't ask ""whose fault was that?""  they knew exactly when the contract expires, they knew exactly what will happen at renewal, but they kept doing the same thing.  this really showed me those guys still didn't understand what happened. many people blame uaw for the whole mess, which i think has a lot to answer to (if not them, much of the mess would not have happened).  but it really was the execs, like lutz and wagoner and those before them, who accepted the job with nice pay and watched the company drown and had no spine to take a stand, unlike execs of many other heavy manufacturers did (caterpillar, cummins, et. al).  this of course can be said about chrysler and ford execs, too - the latter woke up eventually, but it took an outsider to fix it.  it was the culture."

"July 26, 2014  9:19AM",oldfarmer50, i'd take a little red wagon with a busted wheel if it was free! i was thinking again (always a dangerous thing) about ford and my mind wandered to the new 2.3l turbo model.  considering that a 4 banger is lighter than an 8 do you think the turbo will have significantly better handling? i'm intrigued  that a 4 cly. can put out over 300hp.  what's the hp of your ms3.  i know your's has gone over 100k miles but i'd worry about longevity of such a highly stressed engine.
"July 26, 2014  1:34PM",abacomike,
"July 26, 2014  2:26PM",roadburner," the engine in my ms3 is a 2.3 liter that puts out 263 bhp stock. i added a mazdapeed cold air intake that added 24 bhp and recently  installed a hypertech tune so it is currently making over 300 bhp. it now has 141k on it and the last used oil analysis(at 135.5k) indicated that the motor is in excellent shape. the turbo and valve timing actuator were replaced under warranty(at 27k and 47k respectively-both known issues on early build car). i also replaced the egr valve at 69k and the thermostat at 131k. i change the oil at 7.5k using mobil 1 extended performance 5w-30 and  the coolant gets changed every two years. what you need to remember is that at cruise and/or small throttle openings the engine is not operating under boost, so there is little to no additional stress placed on the engine. if you constantly operated the engine at full throttle you might well effect the longevity of the engine, although in my experience even the occasional track weekend doesn't hurt anything, the mazda boards do contain stories of blown engines, but in virtually every case the engines have been significantly modified and or have received a ""home brewed"" ecu tune. i wouldn't lose any sleep over owning a 4 cyl. turbo- but then i've owned three a 1984 thunderbird turbo coupe, a 1991 volvo 740 turbo, and my 2007 ms3."

"July 27, 2014 12:52PM",graphicguy," had a sleep number.  the one i had had to be ""reset"" every month or so as the air bladders had some sort of slow leak.  after several months of them sending out new bladders and me constantly disassembling/reassembling, i requested a refund as ot could never be fixed.  they balked.  finally went all the way to someone at the exec level, who reluctantly refunded my money, less a pro-rated amount (even though it never worked right from the beginning) and had to pick up the shipping tab to their warehouse (they wouldn't let me return it to the store where i bought it). never again.  will ward off anyone who asks from doing business with them. for that money, get a nice temperpedic."

"July 28, 2014  4:25AM",roadburner," herewith my review of the 2014 dodge v6... i'll begin by noting that the 2015 dodge receives some significant upgrades besides the availability of the mega-horsepower hellcat; the 8 speed zf autobox and a ""super track pak"" are now available with the v6. and a new interior manages to look both more modern and more retro at the same time. as for the 2014 i drove, i can sum it up in two words big chrysler. and i don't mean that as a slam. the thing is huge- 198"" long and 4,000 pounds. still, the 305 bhp pentastar does a decent job of moving the big sled down the road; while a 0-60 in the mid sixes and a 15 second quarter mile cannot be considered even remotely fast, it is adequate for this car's intended purpose. and it is relatively efficient, averaging 29 mpg at an 80 mph cruise. the 5 speed automatic works ok, but it isn't all that responsive in manual shift mode. and i think that the sideways autostick function is beyond moronic; left to downshift, right to upshift? which imbecile gave the green light to that? handling is again, adequate. while i would prefer much tighter shock damping and roll stiffness, the person who buys this car is never going to come close to pushing it to its modest limits. steering effort was high(which most drivers think-wrongly-equates to steering feel) but not very communicative. still, it was fine for the type of driving this car encourages. ditto for the brakes. the car is a brilliant interstate chrysler, quietly soaking up most every road imperfection with little to no floating or wallowing- it felt almost european as opposed to a domestic land yacht. i liked the interior; the cloth seat(with power lumbar support) were at least as comfortable as the base seat in my wife's e90 bmw but not nearly as comfortable as bmw sport seat or the chairs in my ms3. the base sound system sounded remarkably good. the trunk is cavernous, and the lid uses gas struts so no hinges intrude on the trunk space. the v6 is just not my kind of car, but it is perfect for the demographic it is aimed at. as for me, if i had the money and garage space i'd buy an srt just to take to cruise nights and for longer trips with two passengers."
"July 28, 2014 10:23AM",oldfarmer50," ""...while a 0-60 in the mid sixes and a 15 second quarter mile cannot be considered even remotely fast, it is adequate for this car's intended purpose..."" thanks for the review.  i concur with your impression of size.  when i saw one up close it looked like a boat. mid sixes is not considered fast any more?  wow!  that's about the best my eclipse will do.  maybe that's why i crave some v8 muscle."
"July 28, 2014 11:30AM",driver100, i am a poor craftsman.....i can't make or fix anything.  the last thing i made was a wooden shelf in grade 8 shop class and it was crooked.  maybe i fit the demographic for sticking to the regular mach 3.

"July 28, 2014 12:15PM",ab348," when the dodge first was introduced i loved the design and thought they did a great job capturing the spirit of the original. then i saw one in the flesh and realized it was massive. the car is just way too big (the chevrolet also suffers from this problem). i saw one a few years ago parked next to the original car at a show and the new one is just ridiculously oversized - it is especially apparent in the rear view. i still look when i see one on the road but realize that it really is a 2-door dodge. like most chrysler products now, it almost always comes with a black interior only too, which is another turn-off. too bad."
"July 28, 2014  1:40PM",imidazol97," how do they and the ford compare in physical size and weight? should be about the same, aren't they? just the contours can make a car look bigger or smaller to the eye."

"July 28, 2014  2:01PM",qbrozen," i think y'all know i love my volvos. on the bed issue, we bought a tempurpedic i think around 7-8 yrs ago. fortunately, my chiropractor made himself a dealer and was passing them through to his customers at cost, so i only paid about $1100 for the california king. so pretty near the cost of a high-end spring mattress. i have no doubt this will last a very long time. while i wouldn't consider it the most comfortable bed in the world, it has helped my back issues immensely. not too long ago, i got one of those amazon ones for my son. i think it was $200 or so for the thicker model (twin). i really like that one. it is softer than our tempurpedic. not sure if it will have the longevity of ours, but, for the money, i'd say its a good compromise."
"July 28, 2014  2:11PM",Michaell," thanks to all who responded to my request for information about sleep number beds. after careful consideration - including reading unbiased reviews and comparisons on the web - we've decided to stand pat on getting a new bed for the time being. if anything, we may go the route of a memory foam mattress next time around. the next home improvement item for us are some new window coverings for the home office and the window on the landing of our stairs."

"July 28, 2014  3:29PM",stickguy, x3 looks nice. seems pricey for a 4 year old one.  but i a always underestimate sticker price on new ones.
"July 28, 2014  3:31PM",qbrozen," that price is pretty nuts. as a trade, you'd be lucky to be offered $29k for it. let's say it hits their lot at $31k to be generous. add $2500 cpo and $2k profit and let's say $2k negotiating room and they are still $2500 over a reasonable asking price."
"July 28, 2014  3:39PM",graphicguy," q...that's what we did.  i bought the tempurpedic through my chiropractor at cost, too.  i think it was about the same price you paid......or about ½ of retail.  i find it comfortable, and sleep well. the best i ever had though was from a company called dormia.  they and a store in one of the nicer areas of cincinnati.  but, the old one i had was about 15 years old, and started to sag a bit.  when i went to buy another, their store was gone."
"July 28, 2014  3:45PM",oldfarmer50," worse than that.  the 2014 ford gt is listed at 3575 and the dodge rt (v8) is 4082, a whopping 507 pounds. that has to effect every area of performance. as to length  dodge 198"" ford 188.5""-----my eclipse is 179""."
"July 28, 2014  3:52PM",murphydog," agreed - while i like the car that is not the price i am willing to pay.  we shall see, we may just hold off all together."

"July 28, 2014  4:35PM",bwia," very well detailed from the photos, but in profile it looks more like a station wagon than an suv. as to the price, it looks like a printing error. the car seems overpriced by $10k."
"July 28, 2014  5:47PM",driver100," i think you will love it.  price seems a little high to me...just a guess but 3 or 4 years old should be about 60% of original cost price i would think. i highly recommend a bmw extended warranty. i also prefer the lighter color interiors...that's something you may want to see to compare. good luck, i don't know how you couldn't love it!"
"July 28, 2014  6:43PM",Kirstie_H," we did the same for our guest room bed, and it's the most comfortable bed in the house.  it's more comfortable than our tempurpedic knock-off mattress in our own room, actually.  you definitely need the deep-pocket fitted sheets, though."
"July 28, 2014  6:52PM",imidazol97," not old buick are spongy. however, the bmw ride is definitely taut until, of course, the shocks wear out. speaking of the german ride, i'm realizing that may be what i liked about my chevrolet. its epsilon ii platform came from german design with opel. the buick i had test driven years back when they first started importing the buick was really tight. i didn't care for it. but i love my chevrolet on the same epsilon ii platform but modified. re the buick. it's in the maintenance. let the struts and shocks wear as do many owners thinking as long as it steers down the road, things are fine. but if the struts and shocks were replaced at recommended intervals, the car is much different. crown vics, gran marquis, lincoln may also exhibit the same wear with age softening in a ride that is already smooth."
"July 28, 2014  6:59PM",isellhondas," i just had the front struts replaced on our 2003 honda with 78,000 miles.  i wouldn't have replaced them except a shock mount went bad and i was getting a slight clunk at certain times.  i know a lot of people wouldn't have even noticed or cared. the old struts must have been going weaker with time because wow does the car ever ride better and it tracks like an arrow now!"
"July 28, 2014  7:38PM",imidazol97," i made the same mistake with my 03 and didn't think about replacement until 80k and then took a while to decide what struts to use. the front struts were so soft i could push them in and out with one hand as far as slow speed motions were concerned. the new ones were rock hard by comparison. the replacements are the same for all the bonnevilles 2000-05 so they were harder than a buick driver might have wanted. i loved them. now i'm replacing the replacements them after 65,000 miles  with quick struts by monroe. in fact that was my excitement for the weekend. not a sales story, but both struts had the same bolt rusted to the threaded part of the top plate of the strut. couldn't turn them out because the ""nut"" was spinning. had to grind each one off. then put the replacement quick struts on and didn't realize the bottom hole was now a slot. so i had way too much camber on both wheels. had to learn from the internet about that problem and readjust the bolts holding the wheel to the car so it was close to the correct alignment position. love my shadetree neighbor with all the heavy tools including an electric impact wrench."
"July 28, 2014  9:48PM",oldfarmer50, re struts what are you guys paying for a set of struts?  i'm seeing a need to replace the front air shocks on the lincoln in the future and their cost is...well...shocking. $300 each just for the part.  i can get a coil replacement kit for all four corners for about the same price so i'm wondering what's the advantage of keeping the original air system.
"July 28, 2014 10:21PM",graphicguy," i dunno about you guys, but before i even had a driver's license i was pouring over car trade rags.  i started out getting a subscription to motor trend.  but, after the news came out that they were influenced by their advertisers, i switched to car and driver.  that's where i found great auto journalists like david e davis, brock yates, and many others.  the one i enjoyed reading the most was jean (lindamood) jennings.  she was as irreverent as davis, but wasn't nearly as stuffy....and funnier to boot. anyway, she moved onto automobile mag as their editor and i lost track of her after that. however, i just stumbled upon this gem......."
"July 28, 2014 10:26PM",bwia," <i>  the one i enjoyed reading the most was jean (lindamood) jennings. she was as irreverent as davis, but wasn't nearly as stuffy....and funnier to boot. </i> jean will be a judge in a reality auto show starting later this year."
"July 28, 2014 10:36PM",ab348," i thought she got fired as head of automobile a few years ago, but maybe they brought her back? the splash page says she runs automobile magazine. i find her a bit hard to take to be honest, though i don't know if i'd go as far as her former boss, david e. davis did, in a 2009 interview “i sometimes dream of a fedex flight on its way to memphis flying over parma where she lives and a grand piano falling out of the airplane and whistling down through the air, this enormous object, and lands on her and makes the damnedest chord anybody has ever heard; this sound of music that has never been heard by the human ear. and the next morning all they can find . . . [are] some shards of wood and a grease spot and no other trace of mrs. jennings.” i guess they had a falling out."
"July 28, 2014 10:48PM",robr2," the reality show she is a judge on is called motor city masters and has been on in the us for about a month.  she plays the bad guy. she was one of the first staffers at automobile when david davis founded it.  she replaced him as editor in 1999 and then publisher - not much love lost there.  she resigned from automobile last month in a shake up at interlink, the owner of the magazine."
"July 28, 2014 11:33PM",driver100," i never heard of jean...i guess my days of reading motor trend and car and driver were before your time gg. i watched her review of the genesis and audi 3.  i liked her <span style=""text-decoration line-through;"">  everymans </span> er, everypersons rfeview of the two car.  she talks about the things i care about or want to know.  she is just a bit much to take....don't know why the wild clothes but i guess it is to make an impression. worth watching to get some insight about a particular model. i won't be watching the new show in hd though....same as jessica fletcher, better in ld."
"July 28, 2014 11:35PM",imidazol97, price them out and then check on amazon for the same part number as well as rockauto.com. i've read about a lot of people replacing the air systems on the lincoln because of problem with them. them have replaced them with some kind of shock that doesn't require the air. is your car one of those where if you jack up one corner without disabling the system it screws it up? i'd sure do some reading before spending lots for the replacement air shocks to find out what has worked for others. some people replace the rear shocks on lesabre/bonnevilles which have automatic load-leveling ability because the compressor goes out on them and folks don't want to get a used one or pay for new or even troubleshoot the system. but it's a lot simpler than yours.
"July 29, 2014 12:19AM",explorerx4," i think the lincoln has air springs, not air shocks. when they fail, you've got a low rider."

"July 29, 2014  1:43AM",fushigi," we bought a king size select comfort back in '02.  the mattress has been near flawless (one time one of the hoses came loose; we just re-seated it).  one of the box springs (which are rigid for air mattresses) had an issue with sagging which i fixed by putting in slats underneath. overall we're very satisfied.  my wife has back issues that i won't go into but the mattress allows her to have a firm surface while i prefer it softer.  occasionally she adjusts if the day leaves her with more back pain. when we bought we bought a more basic unit.  no topper or anything fancy; we just didn't feel it was worth the money (the mattress topper actually muted the air inflation effect). btw, some holiday inns now offer sc beds."
"July 29, 2014  4:45AM",Michaell," too funny. i got my first subscription to c&amp;d in 1976, when i was 12. i remember the cover of the first issue i got in the mail ... bunch of staff members in a field surrounding a jeep (cj-5 or cj-7). ""pig of bronze"", or some such. been a subscriber off and on ever since. i also love the automobile writing of p.j. o'rourke. and peter egan, recently retired from r&amp;t."

"July 29, 2014  9:34AM",oldfarmer50," yeah, that's what i meant.  whatever you call them, they are expensive. my car has a feature when at 60mph the system lowers the car an inch for better handling but i notice after sitting for a while the front end is a little lower than the back.  probably a slow leak somewhere so i'm probably looking at replacement at some point. imid, yes you have to turn the system off before you lift the car.  i put a note to do so on the dash when i have tires or oil changed.  who knows if they do it which may be why i'm seeing problem."

"July 29, 2014 10:59AM",oldfarmer50, i gotta get me one of these. who can loan me $20k?
"July 29, 2014 11:51AM",imidazol97," my memory from reading is that some people actually installed real spring instead of the air supports and eliminated the air system. that sounds expensive, but probably isn't now for someone who knows what parts are needed and can cull them from a recycling yard or buy new."
"July 29, 2014 11:56AM",driver100, family can help you through such times.  it is a time to reflect on how frchevrolet life is.  a few seconds or just one decision can totally change someones life.  hopefully your family will benefit from this time together.

"July 29, 2014  2:15PM",graphicguy," looks like the british ""atom"". i didn't know jean jennings had left/was asked to leave automobile mag. i did know that she and davis had a falling out.  never heard why or how, though.  from what i remember, she was his hand picked successor at automobile. i think most media types, even local podunk radio djs have ego issues.  i know one of the main reasons i don't listen to guys like imus, stern, etc is because they spend more time stroking their own egos on air, while tearing down those who work for them, that it really makes me cringe. i'm more into podcasts these days.  i download them to my iphone at the beginning of the week, and bluetooth stream them in my car while driving. i like adam carrola, who is supposed to have the most listened to podcast in the world.  he's' into things that interest me.....car, business, and while a bit crude, can be funny.  i love npr podcast features.....on all sorts of topics.  unless my beloved (and beleaguered) cincinnati reds are on the radio, i don't listen to the radio at all."
"July 29, 2014  5:17PM",bwia," ditto -- i agree totally. on a related note, my aunt is hanging in there. she is 97 and her mind is as sharp as ever. however, the same cannot be said of her physical condition. she is blind in both eyes and both legs have been amputated above the knees due to diabetes. it's amazing to see how she has relinquished herself of material and worldly things. she has given away most of her possessions, listens intently, and always says an encouraging word or two to family members in turmoil. instead of feeling sorry for her, you leave feeling uplifted."
"July 29, 2014  5:22PM",bwia," &gt; pardon the ignorance, but what is a podcast? is it like downloading a movie? and how can you stream the podcast without incurring hefty data charges?"
"July 29, 2014  5:28PM",Michaell," a podcast is a pre-recorded discussion that you download to your player - with apple, you get podcasts through itunes. you can then stream it to your car with bluetooth. no data charges either way."
"July 29, 2014  8:04PM",abacomike," <strong>  a funny thing happened to me on the way to... </strong> late this morning, i was taking dad for his morning walk at the mall.  i pulled up to the main gate and was waiting for the gate to open when all of a sudden, this elderly woman who you could not see behind the steering wheel because she was too short, pulled right through the iron gate, smashing it to smitherines and barely missed hitting me.  she stopped the car, opened her door, looked at the damage, and took off!  i got her plate number and called 911. about 2 hours later, the police knocked on my door and asked me to identify the car, the driver and the licence plate number so they could arrest her for leaving the scene of an accident.  i went downstairs with them and they drove me to the police station.  they asked me if i could identify one of the car parked outside as the car that hit the gate.  i told them which one it was.  then, they asked me to identify the woman from a group of women in a room.  i identified her and they said thanks. i find out that this woman denied having driven through the gate.  furthermore, she was unable to see well out of her left eye.  and, to make things even worse, she did not have a driver's licence nor any insurance.  she had to be 90 years old, give or take a day or two. how could the state of florida allow people like that drive a vehicle.  the condo association told me, on the phone, that there is no way to collect for the damage because she was ""squatting"" in someone else's condominium  who had passed away 4 years ago. how could she get away with that?  what is happening to this country?  i am totally mystified as to how someone could be driving a car (that was at least 25 years old) with no insurance, no driver's license, not even an owner of a condo in the community, and was living on her social security.  from what i understand, she has no family as she has outlived her children.  good grief.  i need to find somewhere else to live.  this place is literally driving me crazy."
"July 29, 2014  8:41PM",oldfarmer50," "".. this place is literally driving me crazy..."" mike, that us so outrageous it's funny! i've heard many stories of the shrunken old ladies crashing into things in florida but never of one squatting in someone's condo. doesn't the condo association have rules against that? shouldn't they have evicted her long ago? who's paying her condo fee? as to the insurance, here in ny you can't register a car without showing a driver's license and proof of insurance. i assume florida doesn't require that."

"July 30, 2014  1:33PM",imidazol97," sounds like racial profiling. wouldn't that be like how the buick drivers get profiled? or the gm vehicles get profiled? in reality lots of bmw drivers in this area a few years ago fit the profile of thinking they are special because of the car in some way. it's as if they expected to be given open road in their lane or they go zoom zoom like certain mazda drivers. i recall several years back before the boom in bmw leases/sales hit with the 4-year service included (iirc), a bmw with look license plate. the ""o's"" had a black dot added to the center like pupils in two eyes, so the plate was saying ""look at me in my bmw."" and then are people who buy them because they like the car, sort of like i buy what i like that serves my needs."
"July 30, 2014  1:33PM",bwia," how much wealth or income does it take to live like a millionaire? i was perusing my bank statement and was shocked to see that i earned only $0.02 on my checking account for july. (yes two cents.) how can that be when i keep an average of $2 - $3k in that account? which leaves me to wonder how can seniors survive on these measly returns on their savings accounts. you work hard all your life, saved as much as you could, and now you cannot live of the interest. bummer. in the sixties and seventies a millionaire lived liked a millionaire. today, it takes perhaps $20 million or more to live a millionaire. don't know how many millionaires are there in the u.s. but they are worth about a dime a dozen."

"July 30, 2014  2:02PM",driver100," probably a good percentage of buyers of a particular brand do have a certain profile.  when i drive next to a buick i try to look at the driver to see how old they are....occassionally i see a young person but usually an older person.  toyota owners, hyundai owners, and honda owners are careful with their spending.  buyers of luxury car buy them partly because they want the world to know they are successful...but, like with other things, jewellery, big house, etc., they probably get enjoyment from owning the car.  ford and pony car owners are people who may want to be trying to stay young...and/or maybe they can finally afford the car of their dreams when they were younger. people may drive buick because they grew up with the impression a buick was a car that one should aspire to own.  it showed success without rubbing it in your face like a cadillac did.  today it stands for conservativeness and having values.  let's face it, gm kept it going because the chinese love them.  it made more sense keeping the pontiac nameplate going....that appealed to the young people in america. bmw, well, sure it says i have money or at lease can afford the lease payments.  i know there are many people who buy a bmw because of the image it conveys.  the car is a sports car of sorts, so yes it may be driven fast etc.  myself, i just know a bmw is engineered and designed right, passengers love the back seat and the ride. i agree with your last statement and i believe you buy a buick because it suits your needs btw....a long time ago in the 60s i remember an article in popular mechanics where a psychologist explained what characteristics each car make represented."
"July 30, 2014  2:04PM",imidazol97," it's interesting to watch some people driving and looking to see if anyone is looking at them in their fancy car. there's a category of folks here who have expensive car, mb's included, that look to see if anyone is noticing them. i recall years back a person with whom i worked commenting that a lot of folks in her community had larger homes and a really showy car but inside the house they couldn't afford to buy furniture because they spent so much of their income on image. and a number had expensive car parked in front of shacks. a number of them worked for the government at the air force base or some other facilities here and had relatively good incomes, but not nearly what's needed for the lifestyle they chose to try to portray."
"July 30, 2014  2:09PM",driver100," actually for the most part i would agree with oldfarmer but change ""bmw"" to ""any upscale car"". a friend took a new 2015 genesis out for a spin.  the car is $62k, has almost 500 hp, has every option known to man.  beautiful leather interior etc.  they are staying pretty firm on the price too....they don't want to discount, want to gain credibility. my friends comments.  the car is amazing, fast, fantastic warranty, comfortable, solid, every option available, very easy to use gps and media system.  would he buy one?  no, it just is not fun to drive the way a bmw or similar car. if anyone really thinks you only buy a bmw because it is a status symbol you just haven't driven one to understand how satisfying it is to drive a car where you feel you are part of the car, the steering and handling translate through to the driver.  you have to drive one to really understand."
"July 30, 2014  3:05PM",Mr_Shiftright," where i live (undercover for the most part) luxury car are like flower pots--i'd trip over one before i even noticed it anymore. it would take something quite spectacular to cause a stir around here---maybe a mclaren f1 in front of the local pete's coffee would do it? fortunately, wine county still has an agricultural atmosphere, at least in this part of wine country, (we also have lots of cows, so we get the occasional authentic smell of farmland)--and so beat up pickup trucks and lexi and bmw park side by side, no problem. it takes a lot of money to be poor in america.

"July 30, 2014  5:52PM",graphicguy," driver...just having been through a lux buying experience with my sister, i think that $62k hyundai is going to be a hard sale at msrp. there's a little place i hang out to watch sports and grab a beer and sandwich with my buds (silver spring house for the locals).  there's a guy there who bought an equs and parks it right out front.  i don't know the guy but one day i saw him pull up and park.  since he was walking into the place the same time i was, i started making small talk.  we ended up sitting at the bar together. eventually, i got around to asking him about the equs.  as he put it, it's a nice car.  but, paraphrasing him......it's a nice car to buy used when depreciation knocks it down to low $40s, not new in the low $60s.  my guess is that few, if any, will buy the genesis new at $60k+.  dealership can hold out if they want.  that's their choice. apparently, hyudais depreciate......a lot. this guy bought his with 6k miles on it.....previous model year. so, moral of the story, don't buy that genesis or equs new.  wait for the dealership to let it languish for awhile, maybe make it a demo, then save $20k and buy it."
"July 30, 2014  5:56PM",Mr_Shiftright," yeah, a ferrari still makes a pretty big splash, especially if it's running. nothing quite sounds like that. it's not my idea of a ""luxury car"" however. it's more ""ultimate toy"" in my perception--more like buying a plane or a 50foot sailboat. something not used that often, requiring punishing maintenance, and some nifty thrills."
"July 30, 2014  7:20PM",ab348," i think it would be a relatively uncommon customer who would pay $60k for a car with that slanted ""h"" badge on the trunklid, regardless of how good that car is. i see a few equui around here. they are used in airport limo/livery service. not all that impressive-looking. as for bmw, i know a bunch of bmw owners. they do not drive them for the driving experience. they drive them because they are extremely image conscious. and while this old joke is not always true, it usually is in my experience what is the difference between a bmw and a porcupine? a porcupine has the pricks on the outside."
"July 30, 2014  7:28PM",imidazol97," now there's a car that telegraphs its handling to the driver and really arouses excitement with the feedback. was behind one in downtown columbus (oh) a few years back. took me a couple blocks to figure out what it was. driver had  just left parking garage at rush hour into heavy traffic. sound brought back memories for me from the 409s, 396s, and other great engines of my youth in the early 60s. closest i'd heard was a porsche convertible owned by daughter of friends of ours. and it was much raspier and ripping in tone."
"July 30, 2014  7:51PM",driver100," one thing i neglected to mention was the $62k was the canadian price, it is $52k in the us, it fits the 20% less expensive rule perfectly. i could be wrong, but i think if you can afford a bmw that is about $62k to $66k, you aren't likely to care about saving $10 to $16 grand to get the no-name product.  for $25k, getting a sonata is not an image breaker......but, at over $50k it does come into play. for me, i just wouldn't take a chance on an unknown.  buying the unknown compared to buying a bmw which i know performs and is engineered well is just not worth the risk. btw...i think the h does appear on the trunk lid, but, it will probably disappear once they sell the genesis in it's own dealership."
"July 30, 2014  8:02PM",bwia," true, but few seniors have stock investments. in an article on retirement trends, msn money reports the following ""the average income for those between ages 65 and 69 is $37,200, but drops to a little less than $20,000 for those over age 80. the main sources of income for people over 65 are social security (37 percent), income from working (30 percent), pensions (19 percent) and savings and investments (11 percent). younger retirees derive more income from working and investments, while older retirees rely more on social security."" source"

"July 30, 2014  8:23PM",Mr_Shiftright, the trick is not to be spending your retirement money as if you were still earning a salary. your salary doesn't go up and down with every bump in the economy but your investments sure can.
"July 30, 2014  8:25PM",fezo," that's a good deal to have.  didn't have that option myself but between ss and pension i'm not too far off where i was when i was working.  have to find that well managed mutual fund and have discovered my wife with the 401ks hasn't paid a whit of attention to them.  this should not surprise me as i handle all the regular stuff.  i was in not intrude mode but in the unlikely event that she went first i'd be financially screwed.  never too late to fix a mistake but it'll never get where it could have been. liked to see the old bmw porcupine joke.  we actually had to stop for a porcupine crossing the road.  not every day you see that.  vacation was a blast and may change the when i change tires equation.  3,500 miles of tooling around makes a notable difference.  we went through niagara falls, up across the bruce peninsula taking the ferry to manitoulin island (where we saw the porcupine), up to the soo, drove up a good part of the east side of lake superior  and took in a load of lighthouses.  we have these lighthouse passports.  you need 60 to fill them.  we're a bit less that halfway there. that said health issues got to be part of that.  last checked the platelets were dropping precipitously.  that can't stay that way.  i've been wiped out but mostly managed to keep up and the collapse for a couple of days. i see 650 posts to catch up on so i imagine i've missed discussions of garbage disposals, toothpaste, cheap solar panels and what not.  i'll have to live...."
"July 30, 2014  9:03PM",venture," &gt; strangely enough, when it came time to trade my bmw i didn't buy another one. i loved the handling and power, but didn't like the negative connotation. people who knew me knew i drove a bmw because i am a ""car guy"". others who didn't know me well, or didn't know me at all, figured it was a status thing. i like to fly under the radar a little. i bought a mazda 6 gt - that i loved btw."

"July 31, 2014 11:38AM",driver100," it sounds like a good plan, but, it can't work quite the same.  if motels have empty rooms, they don't generate income, but most costs of running a business stay the same.  there is logic in just getting some income from renting a room at a lower cost to lure a customer in.  half the cost of the room is better than nothing.  however, a car costs a certain amount to produce, not much use in going below the cost price of the car unless you are liquidating or have to get rid of it because it isn't moving at all. that's how i see it....skeptical.  i think the savings wouldn't be enough to make it worthwhile, unless you were isell who doesn't care what make, color, model, number of cylinders, color of interior, etc. the car has."

"July 31, 2014  2:45PM",driver100," lol....but, my points are reasons i don't think the plan would work.  i don't believe in it, but, i don't know the real business model.  i spent a fair bit of time writing to a reporter we were asked to contact, wanting to know if we would buy a second convertible.  i gave her good solid information but never heard back, though i was told i would. i would definitely give input if it was a topic i had some good solid information about, or a knowledgeable opinion about.  i am kind of a sucker for doing surveys.  i feel i benefit from them so i feel i should contribute.  i have over 100 contributions on tripadvisor."
"July 31, 2014  2:58PM",driver100," i was listening to a progdodge about retirement, and the financial expert said you shouldn't buy a fancy car because you will lose the thrill of a new car in a very short time.  i don't think that is true at all, i love and appreciate the bmw every time i start it up. could you earn almost 5% a year on your savings?  you may need some dividend paying stocks so you have a secure amount coming in to pay for essentials, then some stocks which may appreciate in value to try to gain another few points, say 7%.  if you can set $8k a year aside a year from retirement savings, old age pensions etc., then you could probably afford a mid range luxury car every 4 or 5 years. what concerns me, and many people don't think about it, is prices double about every 10 years. so, although you may be able to live on $40k or $50k today, could you live on that if it was worth half in 10 years?  i think you have to try to reinvest some of your retirement income, unless you have a pension with a cost of living component."

"July 31, 2014  3:24PM",driver100," here is my dilemma (dilemna). i am driving my 2012 bmw 535 and it has about 42k miles on it. the warranty will be up at 48k. i love my car, but getting kind of itchy to trade.  the frontrunners would be another 535 and an audi audi, also consider a jaguar and mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz, though they are long shots. the 535 and the audi are going to be radically changed for 2016, the 2015s will just have some minor updates. i have been leaning towards waiting for another year until the 2016s come out. then, i just checked the used car value of my 2012.  using the canadian black book my car is worth about $35k today.  they forcast my car will be worth $31k in 12 months and probably more like $29k by next november when the new one's come out.  that means getting a new car now would probably cost an extra $3k or $4k over waiting a year.  maybe even less when you count paying for service work and oil changes because i will be past the warranty period. i know it isn't a serious problem to have, but, it is a bit of a conundrum.  any opinions, besides buying a buick or genesis?"
"July 31, 2014  3:27PM",imidazol97," i have always found the idea of camping out not a concept for me. i consider ""roughing it"" to mean holiday inn chevrolet rather than hampton inn or fairfield inn (the fairfield in pigeon forge at least). hamptons are uninissanlly fairly good, so far. the boy scout troop scoutmaster considered it a personal victory that i camped out several times with my son on local camp outs. he's the one who, with his son, camped out in his front yard one night when it had snowed and was going down below -10 deg. f. ain't that the truth. i love driving most of the time. i enjoy the scenery. i enjoy the time in the car that i like driving. stopping for fuel or rest stop is interesting to see and meet people from other areas. i especially enjoy travel on i75 and i75 through ky where i recall traveling when the interstate roads were still being built."

"July 31, 2014  4:43PM",stever," right, mackinac island is car-less (except for emergency vehicles). they don't permit volkswagen car either so the thing to do is get an electric ""handicapped"" scooter. we spent the morning there a couple of days ago. the best ride was the little girl on her unicycle. nice enough spot except it's all tourists, all the time. we didn't take much time to walk the neighborhoods but that's the thing to do, or walk or bike the 80% of the island that's park land. if you don't do that you may as well go to gatlinburg and never look at the smokies. i'm a temporary yooper living a couple of blocks from lake superior in a small town. we moved there 4 years ago to enjoy some time with my wife's step-mom and durn if she didn't live all that long, so our timing was good for the move. nice people, lots of trees, mixed bag on winters (last one was a bear). we're ready for some topography again so we're moving to new mexico in a few weeks. the current ride is an '09 dodge grand caravan. our '99 quest got to 200,000 but it kept acting up and we couldn't trust it long enough for the move. so we got this used van a few months ago. we did a load in it last month and are running a load to family this trip. one more load will get us permanently moved and then we'll start shopping again for a new car."

"July 31, 2014  6:22PM",rbirns1," today is the end of the month.  let's say i negotiate a deal late today and put down a deposit, arranging to take delivery tomorrow.  if the deal improves tomorrow (i.e. new august incentives), can i back out of the original deal and get the new offer?"
"July 31, 2014  6:42PM",driver100," just my opinion, you really need one of the sales reps to answer this - however since this is the last day of the month here is my quick gut feeling reply.  doubtful if you could change the contract once you sign it, unless, you add a clause, if any additional discounts are offered for august and then you could get the lower price.   but, i doubt a dealer would honor it if he is selling you the car at a discounted price to make his quota.  it won't help him putting the sale into next month. if he has reached his quota then he isn't giving you an extraordinary discount, and the dealer may hold on to the paperwork for an extra day. i bought my 2012 in 2011 before prices were announced.  we agreed on an amount for the trade-in, and we agreed to a percentage discount on the new car.  that way the actual price didn't matter, it might go up, or down for the model and equipment i wanted."
"July 31, 2014  6:45PM",driver100," everyone is different.  holiday inn chevrolet would be fine with me, i call motel 6 roughing it, in fact i would possibly consider camping over one of those."

"July 31, 2014  6:50PM",driver100," that is kind of my thinking too.  the only thing i have had the car in for is new tires and alignment.  so, almost 3 years, 42k miles, and no problem.  if i go over 48k and have one major electronics problem it could wipe out the savings i get from keeping the car for another year.  i agree, peace of mind is worth something."
"July 31, 2014  6:57PM",driver100," &gt; gg, i know you love those acura's.  i know they get good reviews, and they are solid and reliable.  i have sat in ones at the acura dealership in 2012 when i had my plastic shield put on the 535.  first, i think if you are into electronics the car will impress you.  but, i didn't get the same feeling as i get in the bmw or audi......attention to detail in the leather and seat.  the ergonomics and the outward vision (rear window was high and glass area wasn't maximized). i know an acura can kind of wow you, but i know i'll be unhappy with it very quickly.  was that what mike had for a short time, before going back to a mercedes-benz benz?"
"July 31, 2014  7:29PM",imidazol97," you described this dodge as too ""trucky."" what do you mean by that? from the many times i've ridden in chrysler's vans, they ride well, more like a car than a truck."
"July 31, 2014  7:38PM",imidazol97," gotta agree with you. haven't stayed in motel six since the 80s, and it wasn't good. and the last holiday inn chevrolet we had stayed in (birch run, mi) really wasn't a problem place. fairly nice and equipped for the traveller. it's just that it's not as nice as the hampton inns usually are. and my point was the step to a holiday inn chevrolet was roughing it compared to our usual hampton inn, and actual camping was far down the list. there was that bad hampton inn near michigan city, in?mi? where we checked out right away! no charge. it was a converted motel, not built to hampton inn's usual appearance and layout. sort of like how best westerns are all independent and often are resuscitated buildings of other brands and the corporate name use is just a shell with no real expectations of quality level by the corporation. my sister-in-law (flight attendant) will not stay in one."

"July 31, 2014  8:40PM",rbirns1," well around here it's very common, probably the norm, to drive off a day or two after committing to a deal and giving a deposit.  dealer has to get the car out of inventory, which is often off site, and prep for delivery.  paperwork needs to be done, financing arranged, insurance cards obtained, might need certified bank check, etc.  these things all take some time."

"August  2, 2014  1:26AM",roadburner," owning a german car out of warranty can be done at a reasonable cost, but you have to pick one of the less complex vehicles- for example, if you are thinking bmw then you want a 1, 3, or six cylinder 5 series, an x3 or a six cylinder x5. next, you need an honest dealer or indie shop. finally, it has to be maintained by the book using oem approved parts and lubricants. buy an old poorly maintained 7er and take it to an overpriced and unscrupulous shop and you get what you deserve..."
"August  2, 2014  1:54AM",Mr_Shiftright," all used car are different, all new car are the same. if you buy a used german car that's been neglected or botched, it'd be a bloodbath to make it right. all modern car are complex, so there's no way around that imo. it's not like you're going to fix one with some tools in a fishing box.  even an honest shop has to charge you german parts prices and labor is labor. one mistake people make is thinking that because someone works on mercedes-benz benzes that he knows something about bmw and audis.  often not the case. buy a car that's been loved, and get a thorough ppi and you're off to a good start!"

"August  2, 2014  2:30PM",dino001," it can be, but can be something else.  engineering is working priorities.  formula 1 car are designed to run three-four races on one engine, used to be one but the regulation forced it, same with transmissions.  bmw or mercedes-benz benz are no formula 1, but their design priorities may be just a bit different than those of toyota.  mercedes-benz benz owner of 60s or 70s intended to keep the car fo 10 years or more.  today he/she leases it for three.  there was a shift in late 80s and now it's a strong stable feedback loop, keeping those priorities this way.  the target is to get newest stuff in, have the car work beautifully when new, but durability is no longer padodgeount.  when you squeeze performance and fuel economy combination to point beyond durability limits, something has got to give.  250 hp from two litter engines is a number that was unimaginable 15 years ago, except race rally car, today it's every day, but will those engine last?  who knows.   as long as new sales are climbing faster than market, they have incentives to stay the course. i want to add that some of those concerns are a bit overblown.  many owners feel have no quarrels to drop 20-30 grand on depreciation and financing every three years (lease payments), but somehow two grand on a repair every couple of years takes their breath away.  it is fuzzy math, quoting the classic."
"August  2, 2014  3:06PM",roadburner," exactly. i paid off the 2004 x3 in 2007 and since then it has required only a couple of major repairs, i wasn't happy about either one but i'm still much better off financially than if  i was flipping car every 3-4 years and had a constant monthly payment of $300-$400."
"August  2, 2014  3:16PM",Mr_Shiftright," it's the rare used car that is so bad that repairs equal new car payments every month; however, having said that, as labor costs go up and car get more and more comple, with inter-related systems multiplexing their little hearts out,  i think that gap will close."

"August  2, 2014  4:28PM",imidazol97," right on. and often they are comparing their real world mileage on their current car and accepting the highway mileage figure as sent from a deity as truth for the new car. i notice that many people would rate one car as better over another because the epa rating was 1 mph higher on the epa rating test. same thing happens with people and refinancing their loans. back in the 80s i was running spreadsheets on my trvolvo to show folks that paying hundreds of dollars to reduce their home mortgage interest rate refinancing by small amounts was not beneficial. in fact, they would be better off just putting the few hundred dollars on as an extra payment to reduce the principal on which they actually pay computed interest each month and they would come out ahead by far. all the new mortgage did was put them at the beginning where most of the mortgage payment was interest and very little went toward reducing the principal owed."

"August  2, 2014  4:50PM",Michaell," question for the good folks here .... if you have an older (non-classic) car, do you have full insurance on it? comprehensive and collision? i ask because two of my co-workers at the pizza place totaled their car in the past 6 weeks - one on a delivery and the other in a non-delivery situation. car 1 was an '03 hyundai sonata; car 2 was an early '00's nissan nissan. neither had collision insurance. the owner of the sonata had another car (late model honda honda) that he is now using for delivery. the owner of the nissan had to quit because she didn't have another car to drive. it seems silly to me to drop collision insurance when you use your car for work. just curious as to what everyone here thinks."
"August  2, 2014  5:15PM",fezo," i made a mistake with my mazda 6s when i bought it.  i figured it only cost me $6,500 at the time and i'd never had an at fault accident so why bother with collision?  of course months later i had the first at fault accident of my life,  a guy stopped after starting to move on a green and i let myself get slightly distracted which came to about $3k.  the shop did a beautiful job and i put collision on it right away.  i have 111k on it (3.5 of that was in a 2 week period that ended last sunday) and plant to take it well past 220k.  other than a ding in the front passenger door and a repaint on the back bumper the car looks new.  inside there's slight sign of age but nothing serious at all.  it definitely qualifies in that ""gee, i could get so much better gas mileage"" talk but it would cost me way more than just holding onto the car and i love the car.  it's quick, chevrolet and practical to boot.  what's to complain about?  it will need a new clutch but probably not until spring. steve r - sorry me missed each other in the up.  you might have even been there at the time, but between hauling a couple of 12 year olds and calling back and forth to the hospital because of my platelet count my already fuzzy head got fuzzier. once they finally pronounce me fit to go i'm going to do the lake superior circle tour.  have wanted to do that since i first laid eyes on the lake at 22."

"August  2, 2014  8:45PM",stickguy," car insurance in jersey is just crazy.  but on my fleet, the 2007 volvo has full coverage, the 2000 tl (175,000 miles) just liability.  i took a chance on that since i got it in 2008, and the bet paid off.  key there is that is the car that my kids have been assigned to, so the extra cost for c&amp;c is through the roof.  one reason i plan to keep that car hanging around.  insurance savings just about pays for the running costs of the 3rd car."
"August  2, 2014  8:50PM",stickguy," ah, the old new vs. used financial debate.  pretty much a given that unless you have an extreme outlier, the new car will cost more, even with frequent repairs. but, for many (most?) people, those frequent repairs are important.  they have no desire to be dealing with taking the car in on a regular basis.  not just paying for it, but dealing for it.  and if the car is breaking down and stranding you, vs. just routine upkeep, then it has to go. take rbs x3 for example.  financially it makes sense to send it to college.  functionally, if it starts having issues, i bet he does not want to deal with long distance ""general contracting"" of repairs, or hearing from his son that it broke down 1/2 way home some day.   i had this toward the end of my sons senior year with the tl, and it was a huge pain to deal with from home (and a major hassle for him to keep getting it taken to the dealer and picking it up)."

"August  2, 2014  9:39PM",driver100," mike, i know you don't want to trade now, and this possible buyer is not a family member.  but when we traded in our 2004 x3, the dealer turned around and sold it to my sil for the same price they gave me for it.  it was called a family plan.  the dealer doesn't lose because they sell a new car and will probably sell repairs and a warranty on the 2004 car. just wanted to point that out in case that comes up for someone else.  that way sales tax is not a problem."

"August  3, 2014 12:30AM",mako1a," my last ford was a 1998 gt (the rounded one) and i always wanted the more squared off 2003/4. back then they were $15k. this one being convertible caught my eye and i like the color. also has cloth  seat which have more bolster than leather. my max bid will be in the $5700 range. i guess i'm not as spendy as mr shifty. and no, ford you'll have to procure a ""brick"" locally as there is no way i would remove a working mach 460 from a ford. excellent sound system. maybe upgrade the speakers is all. still dreaming at this point. there's probably some guy willing to go to $7k. who knows. the seller is only 30 miles away. i emailed questions, but no response so far. oldfarmer would say ""he's probably out burning the tires off of it"" lol"
"August  3, 2014 12:43AM",mako1a," wow, i'm glad to hear you like it too. i know ford like you know bmw. this one has the molded plastic intake manifold which usually starts to warp and leak about 68k miles. it will have a miss when it's cold which gets less as it heats up. replace or gunk will fix that. the a/t is also a tad weak. a new set of clutches and a shift kit will have you chirping tires in second and third gear. all cheap to do too. other than that they're great car."
"August  3, 2014  1:12AM",ab348," i was going to post ""i hope you like gray"" given the monochrome tones on it, but since you do, great! interesting to see how design themes evolve over just a few years. in the late '90s/early '00s interiors like these were the norm, all one color with absolutely no brightwork at all. today most car have at least a splash of chrome inside and some a lot more, along with wood or other trim and often contrasting tones on the seat and doors. i think these are in a sort of limbo now. i will turn my head for a well-preserved or restored original-style fox platform ford more than one of these, and also for the new model. i am guessing that in time these will start to grab my attention again."
"August  3, 2014  1:18AM",henryn," that picture looks amazingly like the 2001 ford gt convertible that i owned a few years ago.  same color, etc.  i'm afraid i was rather disappointed with the performance of that 4.6 engine.  a week or so ago i test drove a new 2014 ford, base model, v6, and it is much faster than the 2001 gt with the 4.6 v8. i'll admit the convertible was fun."
"August  3, 2014  1:30AM",mako1a, the 2003/4 gt had a 4.6 engine producing about 230 hp. the mach 1 had a 32 valve setup that increased hp to 295. now if you wanted to have the bad boy it was the svt cobra. it came supercharged from the factory pushing almost 400 hp. funny thing about waiting is...the current gt with the 5.0 coyote beats them all.
"August  3, 2014  1:43AM",oldfarmer50, was that the regular 4.6l or the 32 valve?  my lincoln is geared for better gas milage so it's not real quick off the line but i'm impressed at how much oomph it has on the highway.  i know the cobra had the 32 valve with something like 320 hp.
"August  3, 2014  3:12AM",Michaell," the sonata was rolled, no other vehicles inolved, so no chance of a repair on it. don't know the particulars of the nissan accident."
"August  3, 2014  2:23PM",henryn," the regular model.  which is going to be the same as in the car linked from ebay. i loved to put the top down and go for a ride on sunday afternoon, when the weather was nice.  here in houston, it's too d___ed hot 6 months of the year to drive around with the top down in the daytime.  which meant i didn't drive it very often, which is why i got rid of it.  but it was fun...."
"August  3, 2014  2:29PM",qbrozen," when i put insurance on the volvo, the agent told me the collision was like $45. so, yeah, i left full coverage on it. seems reasonable enough to me to pay $45/yr to cover even a $3k car (if they total it, for example)."

"August  3, 2014  5:16PM",henryn," well, like most things in life, that's one of those ""it depends"" situations. case a  you have fairly new car, worth $20k on trade in, or $23k on a private sell.  if you figure 6.25% sales tax, then it's worth $20,000 times 1.0625 or $21,250 when you trade it in.  which means you have lost about $1,750 by trading.  and you have to weigh that against your time and aggravation trying to sell. case b  you have an older car that the dealer doesn't really want, and he will only give you $2k for it on a trade.  but you know your co-worker would love to have that car for his teenager in high school, and would be quite happy to pay you $5,000 in cash, today. one of the problem with ""case a"", above, is that most people do not have $23k in cash laying around.  they will need to finance, and you can't help them with that.  unless they have a good working relationship with their bank or credit union (which a lot of people do not have), things are going to get unduly complex in a hurry. i have sold a lot of used car in my time, most for well under $10k.  never for more than $20k.  if it's worth that much, far easier to just trade."

"August  3, 2014  9:27PM",robr2," unless they are paid as independent contractors, i would say that they have a good shot at filing a claim with the pizza shop's insurance company in order to collect something.  since they are required to have a car and use in in their job, they might have some coverage. of course, they won't have a job once the pizza shop owner finds out. i recently dropped full collision on our 2000 odyssey.  since my 17 yo son is listed as the primary driver on that car, going to limited collision is saving over $600.  the car is only worth $2k and if he damages it, oh well."
"August  3, 2014  9:53PM",stickguy," rob, same reason i did it.  with the teenage assigned driver, it was $300-$400/year.  at this point, i am probably ahead of the game!"
"August  4, 2014  3:28AM",sterlingdog," mike, i have been gone a month and just read about your daughter, and now your son.  i'm so very sorry for your loss and will pray for your son.  i'll also pray for your happiness and well being.  you've had such a rough time but you have been stronger than most people could be.  keep your chin up and know that all of us here are supporting you. i last posted on july 7th.  my bil passed away that night.  we spent 10 days with my sister.  we had a lovely military funeral with honor guard and 21 gun salute by the air force., along with a u.s. army chaplain.  my bil did 20 years in the army and 15 years in the air force.  he was decorated in vietnam and desert storm.  he practiced medicine for 52 years.  besides all of that, he was a gentle, kind, and generous soul.  we heard so many wonderful stories from his former patients who he did not charge when they were low on money or were having a rough time.  many said that he even paid for their medicines, especially the elderly.  we miss him terribly but we know where he is now. i finally got an answer about our garage housing an ford truck.  i had an architect and an engineer team to check it out for me.  it can be done to the tune of $20,000.  the top and sides of the garage would have to be removed and supported by a temporary structure.  the center column would then be removed completely and replaced by three angular steel beams which would support the original brick once it was placed back in position.  the new mortar between the original bricks would have to be colored to match the old mortar in the rest of the house.  it would actually become an historic restoration project.  there are two things for sure.  first, i don't want to mess with the integrity of this home.  secondly, i do not want to spend an extra $20,000 just to have a truck.  my wife was so sweet.  she told me to just get the truck and park it on the side street next to the house.  i don't want to do that either.  i then turned my attention to a honda honda.  while i was looking around, i read where the honda design will be completely changed in 2016.  well, that takes care of that.  now i am just looking at everything. i'll try to post again when i can.  i have just taken a new position for a year as president of our county museum.  it's going to be a bigger job than i thought.  outside of speaking engagements, i have to plan exhibit events at the museum, catalogue all of the artifacts, do quite a bit of correspondence, etc.  it's a challenge but i think that i will enjoy it.  hope everyone here is well. richard"
"August  4, 2014  4:16AM",roadburner, good to hear from you richard!
"August  4, 2014  4:21AM",roadburner," i might be judging full time again... i'm only 18 days shy of the 600 days i had to complete to satisfy the ""senior status"" early retirement progdodge. now it seems that one of the judges i worked with for over a decade may retire in 2-3 months due to some health issues. if that happens, the vacancy would be filled by a special election in november 2015. the governor appoints a judge to serve in the meantime, and a few people have asked if i would be interested in the appointment. i might do it, it would only last for months and it isn't a bad gig. if that doesn't pan out i might become a part-time persecutor... err... prosecutor. my old law partner was elected county attorney in may(there will be a general election, but opposition is token at best). i told him if he wanted someone to cover trials a couple of days per week i'm the man. what i <strong>  won't </strong> do is handle intake(for example, listening to the idiot who wants to bring charges against his neighbor because the guy flips him off every time he drives by his trailer...). and i don't do on-call(i was available 24/7 for 22 years-btdt). so we will see what happens.."
"August  4, 2014  4:35AM",verdugo," oh mike, i'm so sorry to hear this. best of luck and keep us posted."
"August  4, 2014  4:39AM",verdugo," i realize we're not professionals, but he's not alone. we're here for you mike."
"August  4, 2014  9:28AM",oldfarmer50," ""...my bil passed away that night..."" my condolences richard. sounds like you made his last days easier. new job? where do you get the energy?"
"August  4, 2014 12:09PM",driver100," the greatest gift is to make the world a better place for others....your brother certainly did that,  he is fortunate to have such caring friends and relatives to be by his side at his time of need. my experience in an e-150 was excellent.  my wife and i were passengers in the back and the back seat is very comfortable.  nice big windows, high seating, lots of room, nicely finished.  it was much nicer than i expected and more comfortable than a car in many ways.  however, $20k to convert the garage sounds like a pretty major reno to accomodate a vehicle. bmw 535 and audi 6 are supposed to get complete renews in 2016 too.  i don't know if i want to wait, and what if i don't like them as much?  i am going to try 2015s and start to formulate a plan. i don't know how you do all this extra work...and people always seek you out.  i try not to do things so well so i don't get asked.  i thought i'd be bored being retired but the days speed by and i don't even accomplish anything."
"August  4, 2014  1:06PM",abacomike,
"August  4, 2014  2:06PM",graphicguy, richard....sincere condolences!
"August  4, 2014  2:24PM",Michaell," richard, was just thinking of you yesterday .. that we hadn't heard from you in a while and that, at last post, your bil was resting comfortably. so sorry to hear of his passing, but i truly believe he is in a better place and not suffering. you've gone above and beyond in helping care for him. i should be so lucky when my time comes. museum curator? that sounds like a fun job. always good to keep busy, even though it comes at the expense of time spent here at edmunds. another regular i haven't heard from in a while is jmonroe ... anybody know what's going on with him?"
"August  4, 2014  2:42PM",Mr_Shiftright, oh i didn't mean that <em>  i </em> would spend $6500 for it---only that i thought $6500 was maximum retail everyday pricing.
"August  4, 2014  2:51PM",tyguy," i finally make my way over to the new boards to see how everyone is doing, and learn mike and richard have both seen recent losses in their families.  you both have my condolences and i wish you and your families the best the through the difficult times. richard, i believe i'd make the same decision regarding the house and truck.  the additional $20,000 makes for one expensive truck, not to mention the hassle you'd have to endure during the construction.  i'm in car shopping mode myself.  initially we looked at a bmw diesel wagon and a volvo volvo wagon. the 2015 subaru outback just released and we think it'll fit our needs a bit better than the luxury options.  from our perspective, the only miss on the new outback is how they packaged some of the options.  we'd prefer to purchase a version with leather and subaru's impressive eyesight, but if we choose those options, then we're forced into navigation, push button start, and a sunroof, none of which we want.  if we opt out of eyesight then we can get leather plus a few other niceties like rear seat heaters and ventilation. interesting tidbit for the day  only jeeps and dodge have more ground clearance from the factory than an outback. ty"
"August  4, 2014  4:28PM",driver100," welcome back to the fold ty.  i thought i didn't need or want a gps unit, now i wouldn't want to be without it.  no more maps...no more not being able to change your mind once you start on a trip.  also, tells you your arrival time.  we were coming back home near toronto from ellicottville ny.  a major bridge was closed because a drunk dump truck driver hit the upper supports with his bin which was somehow left in the up position.  we had to take the backroads and the gps made it possible.  also, tells you when to start moving to the right etc to make a cutoff. a sunroof and push button start i could live without, but if you average the price of these options over the life of the car, factor in it will be worth more as a trade-in, i don't think that would be a deal breaker for me."
"August  4, 2014  4:33PM",oldfarmer50," it just keeps getting better dearborn, michigan — the official power ratings for the 2015 ford ford were released on thursday, with confirmation that the pony car’s 5.0-liter v8 engine will deliver 435 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque. that’s an increase of 15 hp compared to last year’s v8 engine."
"August  4, 2014  4:58PM",tyguy," thanks driver!  the difference in price isn't huge, about $2,300 to add eyesight, sunroof, nav, and push button.  the nav is no big deal as we'd just ignore it living in a small community.  a mandatory sunroof is problematic to us, though.  i've owned a couple of car equipped with sunroofs in my life and absolutely hated the feature, to the point the sunroof became a daily annoyance.  i've passed on many vehicles in my last few purchases because of the sunroof packaging.  as crazy as it will sound to some, i'd rather pass on eyesight than have the other options forced on us.  i guess i'll just have to remember to brake our other option with subaru is to go down a model to the premium trim instead of limited and add eyesight without the sunroof (weird subaru packaging).  then we give up the nice wheels, leather, rear ventilation, rear heated seat, acurated turn signals in the side mirrors, and upgraded radio.  we were actually going down that road until we sat in the premium and limited side by side.  now we're thinking limited without the eyesight. subaru has certainly made it hard for me to give them money."
"August  4, 2014  5:16PM",tyguy," oh, i was meaning to post a couple weeks back when i was in germany on business.  wonderful trip and i made sure to drive versus taking public transit.  ahhhh, the famed autobahn.  in two hours of driving i managed to drive an impressive two kilometers and never left neutral or first gear. no joke.  two kilometers, two hours.  the audi autobahn. as i walked around the autobahn, literally, and conversed with the locals, it sounded like holiday traffic and a wreck were the causes of the gridlock.  nice people.  german station wagons were everywhere loaded with gear and pulling travel trailers. later on, after getting lost in the country, and in the dark, barely avoiding deer, and eventually rejoining the autobahn, i did manage 170-200 km/h for a couple of hours.  at that speed i was simply traveling with traffic in the left and middle lanes.  the separated white lines kind of blur together at those speeds. i had a turbo charged gasoline seat leon fr with a tight suspension that handled the autobahn speeds quite nicely, but even so, i kept an eye on oil temperature at those sustained speeds to ensure the rental company wouldn't be charging me a rather lofty sum before they let me leave the country."
"August  4, 2014  6:39PM",bwia, and you drove at those speeds (105 - 124 mph) without a valid german license? and in a rental car to boot? wow!
"August  4, 2014  7:37PM",tyguy," having the right car definitely helps.  the audi autobahn has segments of unlimited speed between the cities, and then it drops down to regulated zones of anywhere from 90 km/hr to 130 km/hr.  at first i didn't understand the german signage and kept my speeds rather checked.  once i learned the speed sign meanings i stepped up my speeds to stay with traffic in the two leftmost lanes for the unlimited segments.  for the regulated areas i kept my speed right at the speed limit in the right lane as i was concerned about the heavy use of traffic cameras. it's amazing how fast the germans will pass slower lorry traffic in the right lane, but everyone, and i mean everyone, is very disciplined about use of the different lanes.  no hanging out in the fast lane, period.  it was a refreshing experience to drive on perfectly maintained roads and along trained drivers."
"August  4, 2014  8:05PM",Mr_Shiftright, if americans had to pass all the requirements for  a german driving license we be a nation on horseback.
"August  4, 2014  8:53PM",houdini1," richard, i had a pretty good idea of where you were and what you were going through. so sorry for the loss of such a fine man.  it always gives my heart a lift when i hear about someone such as your bil. he, indeed, left this world a better place. hope your sis is doing ok. you are all in our thoughts and prayers. you haven't really lost him. he has always been in your heart, and in many other hearts...and that is where he will remain. dan"
"August  4, 2014  9:20PM",oldfarmer50, very annoying. i peruse tampa cl for giggles and to buy car in my mind. today i was wondering what mark viii selections they had. unfortunately some creepy dealers now include a million tags on their ads for other car so no matter what you search for you get all their car on your search list. here's a good example. scroll down to the bottom of the ad to see what i mean. do these dealers really think pulling this stuff will make you buy from them?
"August  4, 2014 11:38PM",oldfarmer50, hey mako1a how's the bidding in that convertible going.  i revisited your link and it looks like your $5000 is still hi bid with 19 hours left.  or do i have to hit a refresh button?  it says reserve not met. does that mean your bid won't cut it?
"August  4, 2014 11:43PM",Mr_Shiftright," yes, if the reserve isn't met, then the ""reserve sign"" stays up. it only disappears if the bid meets or exceeds the secret number. also we should all keep in mind that ebay car auctions are not binding in any way. you can bid and then renege, or the seller can refuse to sell you the car at the bid price.  the worst that could happen to either buyer or seller is a nasty comment. same for any real estate sold on ebay.  other types of auctions do have protections from ebay."
"August  4, 2014 11:53PM",henryn," i've been seeing that for some time now.  the answer is quite simple, just check the box for ""title"" in the search area at the top of the page.  this means your search item must be found ""in the title"" in order to be a match. i find it very hard to believe, but ... there are things going on in craigslist that are inexplicable.  what about the ads with ""email only"" where they never answer your emails? or the ads with a phone number, but no one answers, and the recording says ""voice mail not activated on this account""? i think about 50% of the ads on craigslist (at least for car) are bogus, fakes, perhaps some kid playing on his mom's computers.  and a very large part of the remaining 50% are curbstoners.  it's getting out of hand, the people that run craigslist need to take some kind of corrective action. on the other hand, when i was selling my volkswagen last month, craigslist is what worked. i also tried autotrader, and received no responses.  so i guess we just have to deal with it."
"August  4, 2014 11:54PM",henryn," yes, that's what it means.  i'm not surprised, a gt convertible in good shape with low miles is going to go for probably twice that (or at least a lot closer to $10k than to $5k)."
"August  5, 2014  1:03AM",stickguy," henry, my recent sales (and 1 buy) have been using cl.  can be frustrating, but gotta go where the buyers are.   mostly i have sold, so that eliminates the stoners, but you do have to weed out the flakes.  but i have gotten pretty good at that. when shopping, you quickly get a feel for the legit ads, and which ones to totally avoid.  still a crapshoot."
"August  5, 2014  3:40AM",qbrozen," you have to be pretty lucky to achieve those numbers, though. retail is $3k over, not private party. private party is more like $2k. then you figure in the cost to prep it for sale, the advertising fees, if any, and your time and aggravation, as you mentioned, and the profit proposition is almost nonexistent in most cases."
"August  5, 2014  4:28AM",nyccarguy," i too would like to chevrolet my deepest sympathies and condolences to you and your family, richard.  everything you've done to comfort your brother in law &amp; make his final days more pleasant are part of what makes you a wonderful human being. good luck with your son.  i'm hoping for the best that it is benign.  safe travels &amp; take care.  please keep us updated."
"August  5, 2014  9:38AM",oldfarmer50," forget german laws, most americans can't get the hang of their own laws. in the past two weeks i have had car pass my school bus full of special needs kids twice on the shoulder as i made right turns.  yesterday i had a woman pass me on the left as i made a left turn and then turn right. what mental logic makes these people think doing that is ok?"
"August  5, 2014  9:40AM",oldfarmer50, that's brilliant.  why didn't i think of that? there certainly a lot of flakes and scammers on cl.  i can spot many of them.  i guess it annoys me as a basically honest person to see the dishonesty of others. i've sold a few small items on cl over the years with no problem.
"August  5, 2014 12:41PM",nyccarguy," besides the fact that it is dangerous, you have got to be a complete idiot to pass a school bus with it's lights flashing.  in ny state, it is a 6 point moving violation plus a fine.  judges are pretty strict as far as making those stick too."
"August  5, 2014  1:24PM",driver100," i saw a news item about a guy who bought a car from cl, a cadillac cadillac.  it was put together from a bunch of car that had been written off by insurance companies.  the investigators said most people would never know the car had been reconstituted.  since the fine tollerances were off and the structure was gone the car was totally unsafe.  the scammers find a car that will be destroyed and use that car for a serial number. i hope i am not in the financial position of having to try to buy a car on cl!."
"August  5, 2014  4:10PM",stickguy," question for the experts.  my son leased a volkswagen in nj and has since moved to ny.  if he wants to re register it, does that gave to go through a volkswagen dealer, or should get call volkswagen credit?  i assume he can't just do at the dmv.  not sure he wants to keep it licensed here fir another 2.5 years, but could be pricey (taxes and fees) to change it over.  i assume he would have to change his dl first?"
"August  5, 2014  4:20PM",Michaell," is your name on any of the paperwork? when i was in college, my car was registered with my folks in ca, but i secured an az driver's license. i'm sure ny wants any new residents to re-register their car with ny tags within 60-90 days (that's how it is in colorado), but i'm sure he can wait until the nj tags expire before he <strong>  has </strong> to do something."
"August  5, 2014  4:22PM",stickguy, all in his name.  not sure what the insurance company is going to think.  technically he us a contract employee.  can always claim just on a temp assignment?
"August  5, 2014  4:23PM",murphydog," hmmm..so the first x3 that we were looking at has sold, however this little beauty is now available any thoughts on price?  i have an idea of what i would pull the trigger at, but curious what the crowd thinks"
"August  5, 2014  4:26PM",nyccarguy," he should definitely establish residence in ny.  the insurance rates in albany vs. nj must be cheaper.  he has already paid sales tax on the car, so he will not have to pay it again when he registers it in new york.  the nys dmv actually has a very helpful website.  he'll probably have to get the car inspected in ny for emissions &amp; safety. when i moved to ct from ny, i turned my ny plates in with a year left on the registration and was refunded money."
"August  5, 2014  4:36PM",oldfarmer50," ha ha that's so outrageous it's almost funny.  fortunately, for the kind of car i would buy off cl it wouldn't be worth it to put together a frakencar out of parts."
"August  5, 2014  4:43PM",mako1a," murphy, looks like the same car you posted a few weeks ago. at that price, i'd be looking at new. free maintenance, new car smell, sat radio. the seller doesn't seem to want to admit depreciation happens. and seattle seems more pricy than virginia."
"August  5, 2014  4:48PM",oldfarmer50," yikes, that could be a can of worms.  leasing in ny is different due to the trial lawyers who run the state.  years ago they started suing the car manufacturers directly for lease car accidents.  this lead to the cancellation of all leasing for a time. while i don't understand the legality of it all, the solution resulted in a a lessee actually buying the car up front and agreeing to sell it back at lease end.  was a big mess. i don't know if you could even convert a nj leased car to a ny registration without some fancy footwork. try this site hope i'm wrong. if he plans on going to the local dmv office tell him to skip the albany location.  snake pit is too kind of a term for it.  have him go to the clifton park office.  much nicer people up there."
"August  5, 2014  4:58PM",robr2," since he is a resident of ny state, he has to change his license and registration within a certain time fdodgee.  as for registering a leased vehicle in ny, here is a link to the information"
"August  5, 2014  5:10PM",stickguy," thanks rob.  i was just going to go searching, and you saved me the trouble!  a little odd, since it requires a copy of the title which would have to come from the lease holder (volkswagen credit). quite the hassle."
"August  5, 2014  5:31PM",robr2, that's because the vehicle has a nj title and it has to be converted to a ny title in order to register the car.
"August  5, 2014  6:00PM",driver100," &gt; it was hard for me to read the website, but, it looks like it has all the options.  personally, i like the light color interior. i'd double check what the price should be on a proper site, but around $36 would seem reasonable.  it will be 3 years old in another month or two. good luck, i think you would like this one more than the last one.  consider an extended warranty.  will make for a great car."
"August  5, 2014  7:09PM",murphydog, driver that is what i was thinking as well.  they seem to be rare in this area.  wife is going to look at it at lunch time.  that will determine if we keep dancing or not...  smiley
"August  5, 2014  9:22PM",oldfarmer50, that's a nice low mile vehicle. out of my price range but if i were a suv guy i might consider it.  little danger of it being raced or beaten. as long as the oil was changed what more would it need? how much warranty is left?
"August  5, 2014  9:47PM",mako1a," the 2003 ford gt vert ended on ebay. all of our guesses $5,700-$6,500 on the price weren't close. seems the guy wants $11,500 for it. are you kidding me? maybe i should trade in my 2013 gt since his is that high, mine must be well over $50k."
"August  6, 2014 12:48AM",murphydog," it all ends up being a moot point.  had the wife take a look at the car during lunch, pretty much exactly how she wanted it, color and options.  i sent an email around 300 pm telling them we loved it and here was our offer...and bam it had already been sold.  the same time my wife was looking at it another salesperson was selling it...going to tough to find that same color combination in a low miles lease return..."
"August  6, 2014  1:41AM",driver100," it seems there is a shortage of good used car.  it sounds like you will have to go with your wife and just go for it if you like it.  surprising they are selling so fast. my 2004 x3 was bought by my sil about 7 years ago.  it has 150k miles on it and still like new.  it has had some repairs but nothing you wouldn't expect in a 10 year old car with slightly high mileage. at least you have an idea of what you should pay.  a 3 year old bmw gets you about 50% to 55% of it's value when you trade it in, so expect to pay at least 10% more than that. once again, good luck.  looking for the right one is half the fun."
"August  6, 2014  2:26AM",henryn," actually, i guessed that the price would be in the 10k range, so reasonably close to my guess.  used car prices are insane, they have been since 2008 when new car sales fell off the cliff.  with no new car sold in 2008, '09, '10, etc., there is a corresponding shortage of used car today, so ...   supply and demand. my friend just traded in a 2011 chevrolet silverado crew cab with 48,000 miles.  she paid right at $26k new in february of 2011, and got $23k trading it in 2 weeks ago.  she drove the truck for 3.5 years, put 48 thousand miles on it, and got $3k less than what she paid. do yourself a favor, just buy new."
"August  6, 2014  2:35AM",nyccarguy, i saw this on my travels through central pa last week.
"August  6, 2014  2:37AM",cdnpinhead," then there was that ""cash for clunkers"" thing.  unintended (hopefully) consequences and all."
"August  6, 2014  3:16AM",mako1a," henry, maybe you're right and i'm out of touch with used vehicles. my last 6 or 7 vehicles have been new except for an old truck i got off ebay locally. just that i remember 2001-2004 gts selling in the 11-12k range 5 years ago. i thought the thrill would be gone by now with the hp improvements in the new ones."
"August  6, 2014  3:23AM",mako1a," <em>  yep, this just out from ""  "" </em> take note there is a squeeze coming to an auto dealer near you. two important factors to new automotive sales -- low interest rates and relatively high values for used automobiles – are forecast to move in unwelcome directions."
"August  6, 2014  3:25AM",mako1a, that color would take some getting used to.
"August  6, 2014  3:27AM",stickguy," my wife would be unhappy and my daughter might disown me if i brought that baby home.  though if she got the hang of the stick and learned how to do burnouts, she might get over it."
"August  6, 2014  3:32AM",Mr_Shiftright," oh, gimme a break. i just saw a really nice low miles one on a friend's used car lot for $6499 well great, he can buy it a birthday cake and sing to it once a year in his garage."
"August  6, 2014  3:47AM",nyccarguy," that's definitely not the color i'd pick if i were ordering from the factory, but would you take it home for the right price?  it's new year's eve, the 2015 redesign is off and running.  ford has mega incentives plus 0 financing for 72 months.  you've always wanted a v8 ford with a stick.  do you go for it?"
"August  6, 2014  3:54AM",nyccarguy," there's a big contingency of us on edmunds that only buy new &amp; a group that pretty much solely considers used.  some car just have unexplainably high resale values and you'll see it on a dealer's lot with an asking price not too far off from its current model year, new counterpart. look at prices of a used honda fit, jeep wrangler unlimited, toyota 4runner, ford ford gt..."
"August  6, 2014  9:25AM",oldfarmer50, that's pretty pricey.  is there some unusual demand for almost 12 yo ford? is the convertible rare for that year? i don't understand.
"August  6, 2014  9:28AM",oldfarmer50, wonder if they got even close to $41k for it. based on mako1a's ford people are paying crazy money for used.
"August  6, 2014  9:33AM",oldfarmer50, i thought there was no color which could make a ford look bad but i was wrong.
"August  6, 2014  9:37AM",oldfarmer50, was driver100 out buying car for me?
"August  6, 2014 11:36AM",imidazol97," i believe that color looks better in daylight than in the camera and screen representation. a local dealer had one a couple years back and put it out on the driveway to the store. they park interesting car along one side of their driveway (which is wide). the color was a little different from the similar chevrolet green. i liked the chevrolet green better, but the ford says ""look at me!"" i would have a hard time putting that one in my garage, but then i'm not 25 and wanting to impress other guys and girls. gimme a nice dark red."
"August  6, 2014 11:44AM",ab348," better than the usual black, dark gray or silver that it seems 90% of vehicles are made with these days. it's a ford, a fun car, so some color is expected. too bad they didn't color-coordinate the interior."
"August  6, 2014 11:52AM",driver100," well, they did get my age wrong, i am not 89 yet. the thieves are getting very creative...who would think you get led to a phony car and then get held up?  i like the plan to combat the thieves if you use cl, the police set up places on their parking lot where you can conduct business. is this how dangerous it has become to buy a car these days?  i really wonder, there are many great things about our two countries....one is a system of conducting business in a pretty honest and trusting way.....it seems like we are slipping back and becoming more like 3rd world countries in that respect. btw...that funky green ford is a bit of a shocker.  i don't mind it but i prefer yellow or bright orange.  i think you have to be under 30 to buy one though, or you will look silly."
"August  6, 2014 11:56AM",driver100," somehow, i would have bet a $1000 on that! couldn't resist...just joking!"
"August  6, 2014 12:17PM",imidazol97," well, the chevrolet color (discontinued) is more like spring grass freshly starting photosynthesis. it's a fresh green that i could almost taste. however, give me a white convertible in either one and i'd be happy. color the interior something other than black. just so you <em>  know </em> , the ford color reminds me more of kermit the frog colors, something of a day glow tone. maybe it's just that it has some yellow in it. not for me. but it probably stimulated lots of testosterone in somebody because it sat out there for a few weeks and was gone, probably with adm on it. this was while ford was running the ford commercials where the ford changed color while driving, something of a chameleon car. i still like ford because they remind me so much of\ my first two new car."
"August  6, 2014 12:58PM",bwia," that's a very nice lemon green---probably works better in a ford fiesta than in the ford. but then again, i am not much of an equine aficionado. give me a chevrolet any day and i would be a contented man. by the way, in the current issue of <i>  fortune magazine, </i> they wrote and in-depth and interesting piece on the 2015 ford 150. wow, i didn't realize the detailed planning and testing that goes into the development of a new vehicle, albeit an all aluminum truck. what i don't understand though, is if aluminum is the most plentiful element or metal on earth why is the raw material so expensive to convert to industrial grade aluminum? edit here is the link to the ford article"

"August  7, 2014 12:16AM",oldfarmer50, i like some of the striping ideas in that commercial.  i always thought of getting the cross hood and down the side stripe seen on that green one ( minus the green).  think that looks nice without being overdone like the white one that matches the guy's arm tattoo.
"August  7, 2014 12:21AM",imidazol97," i like the ""paisley"" style pattern. white car/black paisley. i am feeling the generation(s) gap. on the way home from menards, i saw a kawasaki in that same green and the rider had a heavy jacket and helmet with lots of kawasaki branded labels and lots of the same green as the ford. there's still something about the ford with the sequential turn signals and the shape so close to the two that i had that still gives a queasy feeling when i see good examples of the car. dark red convertible or white convertible--thank you. maybe i'll win another one."
"August  7, 2014 12:24AM",explorerx4," , the 'hockey stick' stripe is classic ford."
"August  7, 2014  1:31AM",driver100," you mean it was invented by a canadian! for the record, i like the hockey stick stripe too.  i just don't think people over 40 should get wild colors or stripes."
"August  7, 2014  7:50PM",imidazol97," i saw a current generation buick buick go by and it had stripes on the side of the car. they were in the middle, not the whole length. they were not in any particular pattern but made a nice eye-catching pattern of brown and tan on the white buick. probably done by a jobber who does stripes. it was attractive."

"August  8, 2014  9:57AM",oldfarmer50, oh oh. feds just fined hyundai for hiding brake problem with 2009-12 genesis models.  something about toxic fluid causing braking problem. don't some of you guys have one of those?
"August  8, 2014  1:08PM",imidazol97," ""instead of recalling the car, **hyundai issued a “technical service bulletin” to its dealers asking them to replace the brake fluid if they discovered the problem or if an owner complained. **but hyundai failed to inform all genesis owners of the potential safety consequences of the problem, the safety agency said. eventually, hyundai recalled the car after the nhtsa opened an investigation into the brake defect. ""the nhtsa investigation found that hyundai knew that brake fluids used in the genesis models did not sufficiently inhibit corrosion in key components of the vehicle’s brake system."". thinking back to my recent posts about the general attitudes toward certain car companies, i recall i was mocked recently for pointing out that some brands were able to use ""silent recalls"" to fix things, sometimes without even the owner knowing there was something dangerous involved. all of that helps the image of the brand of course. that is precisely what kia consented to having done. and this is easier to do with the car that sell in smaller numbers like special car or expensive car. people are so careful about their special car they can be convinced they have to have everything done at the dealer store, especially under warranty, and so many ""little"" problem can be fixed silently."
"August  8, 2014  1:26PM",ab348," indeed. this is a company that has been found to lie about its horsepower ratings, lie about its mpg ratings, and has been widely rumored to use paid agents to influence opinion by posting false positive reviews in places like this. why would anyone trust them???"
"August  8, 2014  2:25PM",oldfarmer50," ""...indeed. this is a company that has been found to lie about its horsepower ratings, lie about its mpg ratings, and has been widely rumored to use paid agents to influence opinion by posting false positive reviews in places like this. why would anyone trust them???..."" and just when i was considering putting the genesis coupe back on my short list of old-age crisis car.  i guess jmonroe's hyundai horror story was not isolated."
"August  8, 2014  3:21PM",driver100," that may be true...may not be.  i would like to see some proof of those accusations before more urban myths are passed along.....such as the one's about high depreciation for hyundai and kia. also, car companies may have silent recalls, but, i am sure gm has had more than their fair share of them too.  it makes sense if there is something that isn't life threatenning that has to be done to the car to do it when it is being serviced. i took the 535 in for an oil change and they told me they had to change a part or make an adjustment, that the car would be tied up for an extra 20 minutes if that was ok with me.  better than booking another appointment."
"August  8, 2014  4:31PM",graphicguy," while i can't speak for the brand as a whole, my son had an elantra that served him well, for well over 100k miles.  i will say that the dealership's service dept was not very interested in doing the work that was actually called for on a couple of recalls.  when i quizzed them, they always said that they were doing exactly what hyundai told them to do. one was a recall on the front suspension.  pretty serious recall.  they had to remove some of the components that were not on the recall to replace the components that were on the recall.  they tried to charge my son for that. after more than a few nasty phone calls to hyundai corporate, we got it fixed   but, boy did they give me grief. i liked the cheap hyundai for my son's school years.  i think i paid less than $10k for a brand new car with 5 year bumper to bumper and 10 year drivetrain warranty (although it was a fight to get warranty work done sometimes...customer service was not high on hyundai's list). but, $40k-$50k-$60k?  not going there. anyone who owns a hyundai, this is not a disparaging post about your choice in vehicles or of you personally.  it's just my experience."
"August  8, 2014  5:01PM",oldfarmer50, mako1a's 2003 ford got me wondering if the stang was one of those car that always commands crazy money used like jeep wranglers.  evidently so is this typical or do some sellers love their car more than they should?
"August  8, 2014  5:57PM",Mr_Shiftright," asking prices are just the seller's first amendment rights--it might have nothing to do with reality at all. in this case, i suspect the seller wants a premium price for the extra goodies that he put in so the car is worth $3000 and he wants another $2k for the goodies--even if we allow him 50% depreciation, seems like he's a bit high by a thousand or perhaps more."

"August  9, 2014  2:16PM",imidazol97," this must mean we need to start reporting all recalls and tsbs here. it seems, however, that finding tsbs for brands is difficult because they are usually indexed by models and years. also some brands seem more successful at not issuing public tsbs for their vehicles but instead effecting repairs in quieter ways. so we need to start looking for those tsbs. they are car specific and year specific in the list here recalls are available"
"August  9, 2014  2:18PM",imidazol97, gm's getting all and any problem out there and fixing them. i love the people who criticize gm for not having run recalls and then criticize them when parts aren't immediately available for fixing all the recalls when they do run the recalls. sounds hypocritical. it takes time to make parts.
"August  9, 2014  3:28PM",driver100," yeh, but, to not be able to park your suv in the garage for 3 months because it might burn your house down - i would be very upset. if i owned such a vehicle i for sure would not buy another car from them. i know gm is an easy target right now, and i won't say any more, until there is another recall at least, but, i haven't heard of this many serious recalls from any other manufacturer.  going forward, gm car may be better than average because they will be monitoring the situation carefully.  for the last few years though they have had a serious problem with quality control."
"August  9, 2014  3:51PM",ab348," this is a misleading copy/paste. the problem with the chevrolet/envoy group is not an ignition switch issue but a faulty master power window switch that can apparently short out. it is a problem only in climates where road salt is used. they have already addressed this issue twice with previous campaigns but now are going to replace the entire switch assembly with a new design. of course, you could just disconnect the switch until the recall is completed."
"August  9, 2014  7:02PM",oldfarmer50, i think gm is taking flack because now they are recalling everything for every little problem that in the past might have been just a tsb.  the media has the gm bone and is chewing it like usual.  they have a tendency to kick when someone is down. i don't think and more or less of gm because of the recalls.
"August  9, 2014  8:27PM",driver100," what is misleading about gm advising people to leave their suv outside because it could burn the house down whether it is a copy/paste or not. we may be overdoing the recalls (though i think it isn't a good thing personally), but, some people will defend gm no matter what.  what would it take to say gm made a mistake, a steering wheel coming off in your hands?"
"August  9, 2014  9:11PM",ab348," i used the word misleading because you started with a reference to an ignition switch recall on another vehicle and left out the part about this one actually being for a power window switch, that's all. since it is a window switch it is considerably easier to just disconnect it or pull the appropriate fuse and continue using the vehicle until parts are ready. or park it in your garage. i'm not making any allegation on your part, just a statement. gm makes all kinds of mistakes. all car manufacturers do. the implication left by some that they are alone in that is what i take offense to. when the new fusion and lincoln were introduced one had a door fire at the detroit auto show for a very similar reason as this. the issue is the continued focus on gm recalls with little mention of any others. hyundai was just forced (under duress i might add, with the pain of a $17 million fine from the us govt for covering it up) to recall a bunch of hyundai fes because the front springs corroded and snapped into bits. just thought i'd mention it in the interests of balance."
"August  9, 2014  9:55PM",roadburner," i have to agree; i'm no fan of gm and i will almost certainly never own another gm product(like toyota, they simply don't make anything i would ever want to own- c7 excepted) but i think that they are no worse than any other mass-market automaker. i've even recommended gm products to a few of my friends and acquaintances."
"August  9, 2014 10:00PM",driver100," you make some very good points ab, but, honestly, if the keys were falling out of bmw and doors were catching on fire and ihad to disconnect the wiring so i could park in the garage i doubt if i would be buying another one. yes, all companies have recalls, and as car get more complex there will be more recalls, and in some ways a recall can be a good thing.  but, i have other choices and i don't have the patience for incompetence.  and, maybe, just maybe these are the things that have to be reported.  what if there are other issues that aren't safety related and the time has gone by where gm has to honor doing any repairs.  and if faulty parts or poor engineering are showing up in the recalls that have to be made, how many other issues could there be? i don't think i am being against gm, if i owned a bmw that had those kinds of issues i would switch brands."

"August 10, 2014  1:59AM",driver100," thanks for the links and it does seem bmw and as one fellow said on your links....if you search any car you will find incidences of fires. most fuel line or electrical problem seem to get caught before there is an incident. my point still, is if i got a notice saying i had to park my car outside for 3 months because it could catch fire i wouldn't buy another one. but, thanks for making the point to everyone, i had no idea how many car seem to burst into flames."

"August 10, 2014  4:22PM",houdini1, some of you guys are acting like paid shills.....
"August 10, 2014  4:47PM",roadburner, yep...
"August 10, 2014  5:21PM",oldfarmer50, what's the difference between a paid shill and a non paid rabid fan?
"August 10, 2014  5:34PM",imidazol97, rabid implies diseased?
"August 10, 2014  5:42PM",imidazol97," assuming someone is including myself in that group, if i were supportive of range rover as the perfect car brand for everyone and if i were criticizing gm and posting about gm's misadventures with fires and problem, would the reaction have been the same? if so, good. (i picked range rover as an expensive vehicle that i don't believe anyone here owns or is tied to as a supporter. if i'm wrong i apologize.) i'm not paid by nor have i ever worked for gm directly or indirectly. i'm sort of like a judge having to make decisions as to whether someone has been fairly treated. i would feel the same about ford were it not that they sold me a 1973 windsor 351 with timing gear/chain problem after 60k miles and had been building the engine for years so they knew it was flawed. the dealers told me if it was over 60kmi, then the chain was worn too much. i had it fixed at the ford dealer, who ripped me off, and traded it while they had it in their possession finalizing the deal the afternoon i picked up the vehicle from the repairing dealer. the oldsmobile cutlass supreme for which i had traded for arrived on the truck while i was finishing the paperwork. flawless."
"August 10, 2014  5:45PM",roadburner," i think even a rabid fan will-or should-admit when their favored marque drops the ball. for example, i will be the first to admit that bmw is ""losing the plot"" as the brits say, by building car that are bigger, heavier, and worse- softer than their immediate predecessors. i've even said that my mildly modified mazdapeed 3 is much more engaging to drive than any new 3 series i have sampled."

"August 10, 2014  5:58PM",abacomike," because i only have my iphone with me out here in california and my son does not have a computer in his house, i've not posted very much.  but we are at my son's so's house for lunch today, and she has a wild set-up. in any case, we all have to think back about 50-60 years ago when our fathers bought car.  during the mid buick (20th obviously), families were either gm families, ford families or chrysler families.  there were no bmw families, mercedes-benz benz families, toyota families, hyundai families, etc., because of the way our fathers were brought up in their homes.  ford was ford, chevrolet was chevrolet, olds was olds, etc.  what i am trying to say is there are still many, many drivers who buy car the way their dads bought car.  as an example, ""....if it ain't a ford, i ain't buyin' it!""  or, ""...if it ain't a gm product, i ain't buyin' it!""  these were, and are, people who are downright attached to a specific make of product.  the same can be said for refridgerators, ovens, electronics, etc. just because ab348 and imidazol espouse gm doesn't mean they are paid ""shills"".  it's just their way of thinking, like our fathers' used to think.  they have a certain attachment to a brand, which is far more american than apple pie. i, frankly, have not attachments to brands.  i buy what works and what has an excellent reputation for longevity and maintenance free performance, no matter if it's a car, an appliance, electronics/computers, etc.  although i tend to lean more toward hewlett/packard when it comes to desktops because of many years of experience with them.  but otherwise, i am open to almost anything. i have a slightly negative opinion about bmw, but that was because of some recent negative experiences with their bmw sedan.  but i would still consider a bmw in the future.  i buy many mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz sedan, but not because i am part of a mercedes-benz benz family, but rather because of mostly positive experiences with their brand. imidazol and ab348 are merely ""brand"" loyal consumers.  i am sure if they had repeated bad experiences with gm products, they wouldn't be buying them either.  but their experiences are obviously positive or they would not be espousing their high quality or performance. there used to be something said for those who bought ""american"" rather than foreign.  but today's foreign manufacturers all have plants, for the most part, here in the u.s.  mercedes-benz benz is building all of their new ""c"" class car here in the u.s. along with all their suv's.  bmw builds most of their suv's here in the u.s.  so when you are out buying a new ""foreign"" made car, most of them are built here in the u.s. by american workers. i conclude my essay on why people are brand loyal by saying, ""...if brand loyal people were not happy with the products, they would not be brand loyal any longer!"""

"August 10, 2014 11:13PM",driver100," guess i'll have to scratch audi from the list. once again, these recalls were for small numbers, no actual mishaps (accidents or death), and no cover-up, no possibility of a garage getting burned to the ground, not to mention house. like i say, recalls are a fact of life with complex products that are changing constantly, and car makers are at the mercy of their suppliers. i am ok with standard recalls.  you have made some good points that recalls can happen to any make and i did learn something of value.  number of recalls ****will not be as much of a factor ****when choosing my next car."
"August 10, 2014 11:16PM",driver100," people are lyal to a brand for those reasons and also to defend what they bought.  just human nature.  you don't go out and buy a $30k car because you think it is junk.  that's ok, if someone can put it down, someone can defend it.  that's why they make so many different kinds of car."
"August 10, 2014 11:19PM",driver100," unfortunately rb, they don't care what you think.  the market for racing car is small, the market for affluent americans is large.  it's a numbers game and the more people the car appeals to the more they will sell.  bmw may have lost their heritage, but they are laughing all the way to the bank."
"August 11, 2014 12:21AM",ab348," i am not a paid shill either, but rather a lonvolkswagenme gm fan (who has also owned volkswagens and toyota) that is bothered by both a ""piling on"" attitude and what i perceive as a bias in the automotive media. many of those now writing about car are what i call the honda generation, and have a preference for asian car that is very apparent in their work. regardless, what i find most interesting is that while gm is recalling everything, other domestic manufacturers are largely silent. chrysler has never been a paragon of quality, yet have there been any recent recalls for them? i find it hard to believe they are producing vehicles without some issues. ford sold my brother 2 new car that are plagued with serious rust - a ranger whose fdodgee completely rusted out in 6 years, and a focus that had a gas filler neck rust out in the same amount of time. both of those strike me as safety-related, yet no recalls. i know that the ranger fdodgee rust is a widespread problem. when toyota had that problem on tacomas, they at least made an effort to make it good. not so with ford. i have learned a lot reading some of the forums here, especially the ones where people talk about buying used bmw. many if not most seem to have serious needs - exploding radiators, etc - yet are there recall campaigns for them? i do not know. all i seek is some balance."

"August 11, 2014  1:07AM",roadburner," well, if you'd read the bmw posts a bit closer, you'd know that the radiator and cooling system issues usually occur north of 100k miles- and often much longer than that(which has been my experience with my 1995 e36/5 and 2004 e83). everything is a trade-off; to me the issues  that i deal with that tend to be endemic to bmw(or mazdapeed 3s, tjs,or t300s) are more than outweighed by the pleasure that they give me when i drive/ride them. as i've pointed out numerous times before, i don't dislike gm. the fact of the matter is that-aside from the c7-i simply do not find any gm product to be even the slightest bit interesting to me. that doesn't make them bad car- they just aren't on my radar."

"August 11, 2014  1:09PM",dino001," funny, you mentioned pie, mike.  american-style bakery goods, just like car, is something i still have hard time getting used to, even after 16 years.  even oath of citizenship could not break my distaste to some of that stuff.  just like with car, there are some excellent bakery products out there, but i find average cake or pie made in this country pretty abhorrent.  i think the worst of them all are so-called ""birthday cakes"" sold in supermarket stores - to me, eating those is a punishment to both the ""honored"" person and his guests to eat those, just as it would be a punishment for me to own 2008 ford taurus, chevrolet chevrolet, or (much worse) chevrolet. i think, in many respects they are very good metaphors for each other.  just like car having way too much chrome and too soft seat and suspension, pies and cakes have too much sugar and shortening, and very little more. things are getting better and trends are changing, i can now say there are some of those american brand car more appealing, especially inside.  seat got better, for the most part, ergonomics improved, quality of materials often exceeds that of japanese counterparts, especially in higher trims of each model, but sometimes even in base models as well, partially due to evident cost cutting at toyota and honda.  however, whether it is luxury (lincoln ,cadillac) or mainstream (chevrolet, chrysler), i still find majority of american branded vehicles bulky and aesthetically unappealing from the outside - i know some like those waterfall chrome grills or ""take no prisoners attitude"" from cadillac, for me it's a repellant, amplified by their horrible advertising.  after that ad that i mentioned already (one with ""luxury through centuries, slaves sold separately"" theme), i'd be simply embarrassed to buy a car.  at this point it doesn't matter if it's reliable, well priced, or has a great content.  all i can see is an egyptian noble being carried by slaves, or marie antoinette waving the crowd before her execution. one american brand car that i have liked over the years has been ford focus.  it was known to have really good suspension, decent engine and performance, sharp lines (most of the generations anyway).  it obviously came from europe, got a bit americanized (engines, slightly softer suspension), but kept most of its good features.  there may have been some quality problem here or there, but nothing fatal.  generally good value overall.  if i wanted a quality economy sedan, focus would be on my list."

(yeah, i know other companies had sludge too.) there was a  poster who was attacking a person who was actively anti toyota, due to their resistance to admitting the fault was the engine and instead toyota was blaming the owners.. the shill followed the poster from forum to forum and befriended hosts and attempted to make trouble and agitate to get the forum closed. even got one toyota friendly group to delete all the old posts, which were full of information about the true source of the sludge problem. that person i found even practiced posting on a site for aspiring attorneys to hone their debate skills. the person seemed to be from canada in the area of a large operation by toyota east of detroit. that was based on various usernames on different forums and information given on the various sites by the shill."

"August 11, 2014  7:21PM",Kirstie_H," obviously there are no guarantees with any vehicle, but after reading/moderating some of those, the problem with the new jgc really stuck with me.  most vehicles have a mix of reviews with mostly good reviews, and the problem experienced don't have a pattern/aren't tied to the same component.  there are several that mention the windshield wipers coming on randomly, and the inability to turn them off, along with a few other electrical wizardry.  those issues + the multitude of transmission woes would certainly steer me away right now."

"August 11, 2014  8:39PM",tyguy," i’m happy to report we’ll be ordering a 2015 subaru outback to be delivered later in the year. we started our search with the bmw diesel 3 series wagon and came away impressed with the drivetrain but underwhelmed with the newer bmw interior quality.  ultimately the lack of published and bmw-supported tow specifications eliminated the option from the list.  for reasons apparently only known to bmw, they’re happy to support european customers towing, but not americans. our next test drive was the volvo volvo with the new 4-cylinder turbo charged engine.  what a great engine and beautiful car!  truly we were impressed with the quality, handling, acceleration, and incredible fuel economy.  i almost can’t believe volvo is able to return such amazing fuel economy given the power output from the motor.  our reservations included a mandatory sunroof, low interior volume measurement, lack of rear leg room, and low ride height. i then commenced an internet search for all the vehicle options available to us using the following padodgeeters in the end, the subaru seemed to be the best choice for our needs.  the challenge came down to how to option it out.  we detest sunroofs.  we want leather and the subaru eyesight system, but to get those two requires a limited trim that adds the sunroof and other options we don’t want. (to be continued)"
"August 11, 2014  8:40PM",tyguy," we considered dropping the eyesight option, but several discussions in the last two weeks have changed our minds.  the final discussion that swung me towards eyesight was actually a candidate i was interviewing for a position reporting to me at work, and he was recovering from a significant accident that would have been prevented with eyesight.  at that point i made the decision that if i could afford a safety system that may save my family, myself, or others the pain and agony related to a preventable accident, then i must act on that ability and choose safety over leather or hatred for a sunroof. so, we went down a trim level to premium and opted out of the leather.  we can add aftermarket leather later if it bothers us, but considering the van we’re replacing is fabric and we’ve been happy for 12 years, i don’t anticipate doing so. once we picked our trim level over the weekend, i worked up the pricing on an excel sheet with the options, msrp, invoice, and my target price.  i also researched contact info for 7 dealers near us.  in the process of choosing the outback, we had visited 2 different local dealers with 2015s in stock that gave us a perspective of the premium vs limited, and we decided to give them first shot.  we visited one saturday, but he told us they were blocked by subaru from ordering eyesight due to heavy demand and limited supplies.  we checked that finding with others and confirmed we could indeed order, we just couldn’t expect delivery until later in the year when subaru caught up. today i emailed both those two local dealers with my options and the price i thought was fair, which was 3% under invoice plus ttl.  i arrived at that number by reading the online forums and choosing a slight aggressive figure knowing i had time to wait if needed.  gratefully, one came back right away with a positive confirmation that we can order and at a price that was just $50 higher than what i quoted.  i was fine with that number, and tonight we’ll head over to place the order into subaru’s system along with a deposit. exciting!  i’m thinking delivery will probably be late october, hopefully in time for me to apply opti-coat 2.0 before the temperatures become too cold to properly cure it.  eyesight has been delayed and the only deliveries with the option have been demo car for the press.  time will tell."
"August 11, 2014  8:43PM",Mr_Shiftright," no of course not. but if you read back some in pop culture you'd see that cadillac was once the ""forbidden fruit"" to a lot of poor people, white, black or whatever. as soon as someone struck it rich in the 30s, 40s and 50s (like elvis or a major sports star), they'd buy themselves the biggest glitziest caddy they could find. whether it was texas steerhorns, or elvis's mink carpeting and gold lame curtains, cadillac and ""good taste"" didn't always walk hand in hand."

"August 11, 2014  8:50PM",Michaell," ty, when i got my saturn l300 back in '02, i really wanted leather. however, the car the dealer had in stock was cloth, so i took the opportunity to add katzkin aftermarket leather (and heated seat). wonderful experience! i was able to choose a custom color that complemented both the interior trim and exterior color perfectly - i received many compliments on the color over the years. it was, iirc, something like $1200 or $1500 to have it added - seat, door cards, heating elements."
"August 11, 2014  8:51PM",cdnpinhead," this is most certainly true.  during the golden years that i lived in the vancouver (bc) area, i kept my boat in west vancouver for awhile (fishermans' cove).  beautiful area, with many stunning dwellings, but there were also the ones with stone lions out front, gingerbread &amp; many other things that honey boo boo's family would prefer. there's no accounting for taste, and i prefer to share my space with those who, well, never mind."
"August 11, 2014  8:58PM",dino001," congrats, ty.  subaru is an excellent choice.  i believe it is literally safest line of vehicles (every single non-subaru model is best pick in iihs for number of years running).  subaru is not endorsed only because it is not ""compatible"" with the image and message of iihs, not because of any actual safety issues."

"August 11, 2014 10:23PM",driver100," interesting observation stick, considering how my day went.  i sat in and checked an audi in the morning.  i went back with my wife for a test drive.  i like my wifes audi, it is sporty and fun.  the audi is competant and handles well, but is very similar to my 535.  some things i like more on the audi, some on the 535.  i like the big windows, the long wide low hood on the 535, the gps built in to the instrument panel, and the faster response.  i like the way the seat are higher in the audi and the steering is a little tighter. buying a new car should be exciting, but, i wasn't overwhelmed.  it seemed i was trading car just to get a newer car with a warranty. on the way home we stopped at the mercedes-benz benz dealer.  we both fell in love with the e350 which will become an e400 for 2015 and will have an all new larger engine..  the interior is so much nicer than the audi and 535 and you can get it in a very light ivory color with lots of black for accent.  i can get a flat bottom steering wheel as a nextra.  it has lots of options, cameras front and back, lane change warning, lane warning, sunroof back and front.  i like white or there is a light gray color that is possible. i am really excited about the e350.  it will cost about 10% more than the other two, but it has a lot more.  the ride is smooth and solid.  no turbos, but it does have 300 hp and has lots of power. i hope they give me a good trade in allowance and 4% off on the new one."
"August 11, 2014 10:28PM",driver100," sounds good ty and i am glad you got the eyesight option.  i did the same with keyless entry and other options i don't need, but i wanted keyless entry.  it cost $4000, but,as i told the salesman, i get half back when i trade the car in and the car will be more desireable to the next buyer. good decision and suburus owners love their car."
"August 11, 2014 10:58PM",imidazol97," it's like the cadillac commercial said a few years ago for the cts, your car should turn you on when you turn it on. get what you will enjoy each time you walk up to it, get in, and turn the key."
"August 11, 2014 11:14PM",driver100," that is true and i liked those cadillac commercials when i saw them - thought they were clever. that feeling is funny, you look at various car, houses refrigerators (back to those again) tvs, etc., and then there is just something that seems so right, and you go for it. when i started out today i didn't think i would be considering a mercedes-benz benz, but, from the moment we sat in it we knew it felt right. just please don't dig up pictures of mercedes-benz benz catching fire though."

"August 12, 2014 10:59AM",oldfarmer50," too much time on my hands. just saw a honda commercial where the narrator said ""if a volkswagen cart accelerates faster than that old car....."" the ""old car"" was a 99 or 2000 ford contour. guess they never heard of svt. must be getting old.  find myself yelling at the tv all the time."
"August 12, 2014 12:09PM",driver100," nyc....car are 20% cheaper in the us.  but, our dollar has sunk and is now worth 90 cents us so if i could buy a car in florida it would cost 10% less.  manufacturers have locked those sales.  they have told dealers in the states not to sell to canadians or they will lose their franchise.  warranties will not be honored, so it is just about impossible.  also, insurance and licenses are basically only good for 6 months...if you are away for longer you won't be covered. i love the 535 too, and i found the audi to be a nice car, but, just not quite the same as the bmw, even though i like my wife's audi more than a 328 or 335.  i really like the merc.  the bmw performs better and handles better, but the mercedes-benz benz is really refined.  it is also the nicest interior by far.  if you get a chance take a look at the console and the instrument panel, seat, etc.  much better choices of colors and combinations with interior too. sight lines are great, large windows front, side and rear.  it is a smoother and quieter car than the 535, and it feels solid as a tank...in a good way. i am hoping the dealing goes smoothly...i don't want a hassle.  this is a very fancy dealership and their costs are huge.  last time we shopped mercedes-benz benz you had to buy from the closest dealer...hope that's not true these days. i become attached to my car and i love the 535 too.  but, i would rather trade now then trade later when the difference will be greater and i pour money into the 535...such as getting tires soon.  i may pay $3000 a year more to drive the new car but it will be under warranty and that means peace of mind which counts for a lot."
"August 12, 2014 12:19PM",driver100," that confirms my plan, so it is good to have confirmation.  my old bmw dealer did not believe in discounting, and i am hoping this mb dealer won't be like that. the salesman definitely said there won't be an e350...i would have to get an e400 with bi-turbos engine and 338 hp.  if the 350 stays that is ok with me.  sometimes lineups are different in canada and us, but i would think those mainstream models should be offered. we based pricing on a 2014 e350 since they don't have any 2015 info.  hope they don't go up much. the audi dealer told me an interesting thing.  if i bought a 2014 they could give me a really good price for cash.  since most people lease audis, they don't want to lease 2014s, so they deep discount them for cash. i would buy a car at the end of the year if i knew i was keeping it for 8 or more years, but not if i expect to trade in 3 or 4 years. i am going to see if there is more info on the net about 2015s.  i knew the audi was going to stay the same but the salesman thought they were getting a major change....i knew more than him.  we went out and found a 2015 on the lot...it was exactly the same. we may go today or tomorrow to try and wheel and deal....not looking forward to it, hope it's easy like ty's deal."

"August 12, 2014  2:49PM",mako1a, i've been thinking about how state inspections used to be two times per year (pa and va) up until 1978 which changed to once yearly with production of better (safer) car. then i started thinking about warranties. if i remember correctly a new vehicle warranty used to be 12 months or 12k miles when my driving career started way back in 1966. maybe someone with more than my 64 years can tell me when that increased.

"August 12, 2014  3:13PM",murphydog," so i have been following the developments for the c class, and very interested to see/drive the c 400 - the twin turbo 3.0 v6 sounds like a lot of fun.  in terms of the e class my understanding is there is a 4.0 v8 in the works - twin turbo for amg duty, but i wonder if they will have a slightly de-tuned version for the e 5xx?  i can't imagine that they will only have the e 400 and the amg e? either ways the early reviews of the c class that i have read are raving about the car.  hope they are true."
"August 12, 2014  3:21PM",abacomike," i did some research online about the 2015 and 2016 mercedes-benz benz e class.  it seems there will be a major change in style and body and interior for the 2016 model year.  for 2015, the body and interior remains the same, but they are deleting the e550 and replacing it with the e400 (3.0 l v6 twin turbo). if you go ahead and order one (about 6-7 weeks before delivery) and want that palladium silver (light gray), you may want to consider the light gray interior - very light like the almond, but a much better match for the interior.  i don't get the light gray interior because it is too light and shows the soiling down in florida when you perspire.  that's why i get the black interior with the light gray exterior. i know i can get a new 2015 e400 for $500 over invoice ""less"" whatever usaa is allowing (usually $2000 off for a new model) less $500 for my mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz club of america fleet discount.  so i would pay a net of $2000 under invoice which is a good deal considering the car is a new entry with the new engine. i would think that if you order exactly what you want you could get what you want for your car and the price you want off sticker.  since you don't want some of the extras, which most dealers order for their inventories, you will probably have to custom order it to keep the pricing within reason. whatever you do, good luck."

"August 12, 2014  5:25PM",ab348," chrysler was the first to start with more lengthy warranties. i found this summary in an article about 1960s chrysler president lynn townsend ""in 1962, the chrysler president introduced the first warranty among domestic manufacturers that covered the engine, transmission, and rear axle for five years or 50,000 miles. in 1960, ford had lengthened its coverage to one year or 12,000 miles. prior to that, automakers warrantied their major components for just three months or 4,000 miles. chrysler’s announcement resulted in ford and general motors increasing their warranties to two years or 24,000 miles. chrysler was steadily gaining in market share, however, and in 1966, ford and gm went to 5/50,000 as well."" those were still powertrain warranties though, so they didn't cover much. it took a while for the manufacturers to move away from the 12/12000 bumper to bumper warranty."
"August 12, 2014  7:25PM",driver100," i wrote and asked my sales rep....er, i guess consultant, and this was what he said about 2014 and 2015. yes, the us has different models for the mercedes-benz benz.   in canada, the e350 is being replaced with the e400.   we are continuing to offer the e550 v8 model in canada for 2015 – where the us is not. there is still the entry model e300, 4 cylinder with 240 hp.  i think that will be disappointing, kind of like the 528.  it is too big a car and loses it's punch and zip at theat power."

"August 12, 2014  7:53PM",driver100," yes, the color we are leaning toward is palladium silver, which is more gray than silver to me.  we will go with the light i call it ivory color seat with lots of black accent colors.  it is almost white, but could be light gray or very light beige, depending on your ability to read colors. you have probably read the explanation i got between the 350, 400 and 550 for now...looks like we were both right. we have an appointment with the real sales guy for this evening.  this will be tough, they will want full price and may go low on my trade.  i hear there are other dealers worth trying, one is 30 minutes and one is about 50 minutes away.  the one 50 minutes away gives good deals i hear, because if they get a customer it is one they wouldn't have had normally. i am sure i will have to special order.  they do have a 2014 350 in the showroom, exactly the way i want it, but getting a next years model has worked for us for our last 4 car....i like doing it that way."

""our car has now been driven at some length by many staff members, many of whom aren’t involved in car testing. car nut or not, ev fan or not, everyone has raved about this car, impressed with its smoothness, effortless glide, and clever, elegant simplicity. in that time, it’s also displayed a few quirks—some unique to tesla. for instance, we had a problem with the automatic-retracting door handles, which were occasionally reluctant to emerge from the coachwork so we could open the driver’s door. tesla fixed that with an over-the-air progdodgeming update beamed to the car."""

"August 13, 2014  1:10AM",tyguy, congrats driver.  the mb sounds like a great car and i hope you and your wife thoroughly enjoy every minute of ownership.
"August 13, 2014  1:26AM",ab348," congratulations! i love those car and yours sounds very close to what i would have picked, especially the interior choice. can't wait to see a picture!"
"August 13, 2014  1:48AM",graphicguy, &gt; rb....i always wondered how cr came up with their home audio/video criteria.  what are these guys listening to?  and how are they listening to it?  how are they setting up their systems? driver.....'gratz on the new wheels.  sounds really nice!
"August 13, 2014  1:56AM",driver100," thanks ty, ab and mike.  btw, we did a last minute switch to diamond silver metalic mike which is a color unique to mercedes-benz benz and is a little different, hard choice between that and paladium silver.  i always wanted a flat bottom steering wheel. dash is all black with dark wood.  door panels have black below the window and along the bottom.  this color should be pretty close for the crystal grey color. the salesman thinks the v8 won't be available in the us to keep the gas mileage averages lower. thanks again for your kind comments...much appreciated."
"August 13, 2014  2:10AM",driver100," not sure if this will work but this is diamond silver metalic; this is palladium silver for the record we liked them both, and i still like white, but the diamond color is not as common-yet!"
"August 13, 2014  2:15AM",driver100, this doesn't do it justice but gives an idea of crystal grey interior with black trim
"August 13, 2014  2:16AM",roadburner," beats me. i'm not one of those audio/ht enthusiasts who champions $1000 power cords and $2000 cabling, but cr errs just as bad in the opposite direction. i think of the old cb phrase- maybe they have peanut butter in their ears..."

"August 13, 2014 10:38AM",driver100," thanks rb, stick, of.....it all happened so fast i still have shell shock.  on monday i took the audi audi out for a spin.  it was a fine car but i liked my 535 a bit more.  i think i like big windows because it lets light in and makes it brighter inside.  our house has huge big windows everywhere...unfortunately i can see my neighbor swimming in his pool...but our trees are almost covering him now. we checked the mercedes-benz benz later monday afternoon and we both said it is perfect.  i was out all day wednesday but we made an appointment for tuesday evening.  we sat down, ran through the option list, looked at colors, they were right on with the trade-in allowance (really good to know what that should be before negotiating), and no balking at 4% off and by then i couldn't get out of it if i wanted to. i am excited about this one.  i'll miss the 535 but i am sure i'll like the merc even more."
"August 13, 2014 12:19PM",bwia," &gt; congrats *driver on your purchase. a 2015 e-400? that is some serious german metal. just out of curiosity, to which domestic or foreign model does it most closely compare? don't know how these car salesmen do it but they are so clever when it comes to closing a sale. i can't remember where i read or saw it, but a salesman once said the more knowledgeable the buyer appear to be about car, the easier the sale. he said the art was in stroking the buyer's ego to make him feel that he is driving away with a great deal. by the way, did you get to looking at the jaguar or is that now water under the bridge?"
"August 13, 2014  1:27PM",driver100," thanks for the good wishes bwia.  all the salesmen i met were very professional, answered questions honestly and fairly, didn't run down the competition at all.  in fact i wrote to the audi salesman and said we decided to go with the old man's car...a mercedes-benz benz.  he wrote back and said it isn't an old mans car at all these days and enjoy it.  he even said at the time, you are doing the right thing by looking around, all the car i had on my list, bmw 535, audi, jaguar, cts, mercedes-benz benz were excellent car, each is a little different and one will suit you more than the others.  he said he could show me what the audi has, but, i was doing the best thing by checking them all out. i liked his opinion and he said the jaguar is a great value...you get a v8 and you will probably save $8 to $10k.  but, you will miss the german feel of the car.  he said the cadillac was a tremendous bargain, it will have more extras than anyone can imagine and i would save $10 to $15k....but, it just won't feel the same. i wasn't excited by the audi as it was almost the same as the 535, some things better, some things not as good, but overall the same.  i didn't want another 535 though i love it because it would be like driving the same car.  i already got my favorite colors, so i wouldn't like it as much. when we sat in the mercedes-benz benz we both loved it, and there wasn't any point in looking more.  i could have, but i didn't.  besides, you get worn down, they do that to you so you will be too tired to look further. i said to the mercedes-benz benz salesman, that was easy.  you came up right away with the right trade in number, and no hesitation on 4% off why wouldn't i just go for it.  no fooling around taking off money on the trade because it will be 2 months older with more kmiles on it.  the last bmw dealer deducted a few hundred $s for that and i had to promise not to go over a certain mileage - hate that stuff.  they tried to sell me window tinting which i have never had and don't really want, and they wanted $600 for plastic coating on the front end.  i think i paid under $300 at a nearby acura dealer who did my 535 so i'll see what they estimate. the salesman did say he didn't like people who didn't know what they were doing and just go on about price.  i think they know if you give a few hints you are knowledgeable and are reasonable they will want you as a customer.  i didn't tell them what i expected for the trade-in....i was testing them to see if they would come up with a good number or try to go lower.  if they went lower i would have given them a hard time and would have held out for a much larger discount.  he said, we won over a new customer to mercedes-benz benz, we got a good trade in, we are all happy. i wanted to try the jag but we both liked the merc, we aren't impulsive buyers, but, we don't mess around.  we liked it, i feel confident about the name, no use second guessing.  also, because of the big drive to florida and back i like the fact there are lots of dealers around just in case. car it compares to, audi, 535, less directly but close jag, cadillac, and lexus.  it has the feel of the road but more refined than the audi or 535.  i think the real driving enthusiast would still prefer those car and i can see why.  the e400 has very stiff steering, but the car feels solid, like it weighs 4x what it does."
"August 13, 2014  1:28PM",mako1a," driver, i need to follow along in your wake. you toss aside better car than anything i've ever driven like an old pair of socks. congrats to the move to mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz."
"August 13, 2014  2:42PM",driver100," thanks mako.  whoever buys the 535 is getting an excellent car.  it is like new.  i sometimes feel like keeping one of these car for 20 years because they get better with age in some ways. i go buy an early 1990 bmw most days and it looks gorgeous. i find it is easier to manage my money by buying a new car every few years.  it isn't the thriftiest plan, it is like forced savings.  my son in law drives his car until they no longer go.  he misses meetings, his car gets tied up in the garage, warning lights are on that he ignores etc.  then he gets sticker shock when it is worth nothing and he has to buy a new car with no trade - in. i am kind of disciplined, but like to make things as easy and simple as possible...this works for me."
"August 13, 2014  2:42PM",houdini1," on car, cr seems to put more emphasis on room in the trunk and whether or not it has a high lift-over than they do on how a car drives."
"August 13, 2014  2:49PM",houdini1," &gt; congrats driver, you certainly bought yourself a fine car and i know you will love it. i have owned a couple of mercedes-benz benz over the years and they both served me well. i am curious if the diesel model is available in canada?"
"August 13, 2014  2:53PM",graphicguy," that pretty much sums it up. while i don't expect everyone to ""get it"", those of us who lean more towards being miscreants, who light up the tires every once in awhile, who pass on the left side, because the middle lane is too slow doing 80 mph, because we take a corner at speeds higher than the speed limit (while dropping down a couple of gears so we can come out of the corner faster), etc.....we're obviously not cr's target demographic. rb.....btw....i see the prices of 4k tvs dropping like stones.  are you tempted (cause i am)?"

"August 13, 2014  7:09PM",driver100," thanks houdini.  it seems diesels make up only about 3% of the total car market in canada and the us.  diesel fuel is much more available in canada, almost every station has it.  in europe diesel fueled car make up over 50% of the market. mercedes-benz benz has a lot of diesel models they are pushing.  i am slow to change and i like the tried and tested technology.  the salesman said diesels are good, but they are slower. i think as mileage gets more important, diesel growth will happen.  they expect sales to be at 10 to 15% within a few years."

"August 13, 2014  7:43PM",fezo," geeze, driver.  between the speed of an unexpected purchase and a mercedes-benz benz i thought that was mike talking. mike, hang in there for yourself and all concerned.  here when you need us. in case i hadn't mentioned it i've been through six weeks or maybe two months of platelets dropping.  we did our whole vacation dealing with that which does exhaust one.  the last week or so i found myself feeling better and having a feeling of actually healing.  go to sloan on monday and my platelets had shot up 17,000 points.  almost makes them to where they were before the episode.  slow and steady once again. so what's up with orange car?  the kid across the street bought a used orange volkswagen.  took a couple of weeks trying to decide if i liked it or hated it.  i ended up liking it but my wife thinks it's hideous. today, driving back from pt what come up but an extremely orange dodge dodge.  i took a minute but i kind of liked it but would never, ever buy in that color! my buddy had an orange porsche 914 back in the early 70s.  that i like a lot."
"August 13, 2014  7:45PM",laurasdada," well done, you are a fine upstanding citizen! as i earlier noted, my xf is now over 7k miles and 7.5 months old=long in the tooth.  but, since the bmw i8 and mb s coupe are not out yet, i'll hold on a bit longer!  oh, yeah.  can anyone give me $120k to buy one?  no?  ok, jag and i shall remain buddies a bit longer. and, another thought on the jag re  infotainment system.  many of the reviews knock jag for it's old, sometimes clunky system.  in fact, that is oftentimes the biggest complaint.  but, you know what?  it works.  and it's fairly simple.  granted, not as slick/modern as idrive or audi mmi.  and, i don't think touchscreen is the answer, a controller may be better.  but, it works. let's see what comes with the xe..."
"August 13, 2014  7:47PM",ab348,"  certain models seem to be able to pull off orange as a paint color. the old 914 was one. the volkswagen from 5-7 years ago had an orange that i thought looked good. but i have seen those orange dodges and they do not do it for me. back in the early '70s, mopar had a burnt orange metallic that was a beautiful color. and of course the chevrolet back then came with orange both inside and out! i see the new 2015 ford is offering competition orange as a paint choice."

"August 14, 2014  2:15PM",henryn," back in 2011 or thereabouts, i was shopping for a used car.  at the mercury dealer, i had picked out a 2010 grand marquis with about 25k miles, advertised online for $16,900.  the salesman and i were negotiating, i offered $16,900 out the door (to include tt&amp;l), which would have made the actual price around $15,700.  i had received a preliminary agreement, and was waiting to go to the finance office to pay out. in walks the used car sales manager, who had just that minute came back from an auction.  he said that car similar to the one i was trying to buy were going at auction for $17,500, and i absolutely could not have the car at the already agreed on price of $15,700.  he did agree to sell it to me at the advertised price, but i was a little miffed about them backing out of the deal, so i declined. and before you ask, no, i really don’t think it was a gimmick to try and raise the price on me.  the sales manager seemed genuinely confused, confounded, perplexed and mystified by the way used car prices were escalating.  it it was acting, he should have earned an academy award."

"August 14, 2014  3:14PM",sterlingdog," i detest that commercial because of the egyptian and african conotations.  it smacks at the idea that only those of darker complexion would, could, or care to drive an cadillac.  that is so untrue.  it's like driver's comment about the old, white fat man with a cigar driving the cadillac.  people of all races, genders, and economic levels drive cadillacs.  some drive new ones and some drive old ones.  people drive what they like, what they want, and what makes them feel good.  there's nothing wrong with that.  what's wrong is that we pigeon hole both car and people.  one of my bosses used to say that perception is reality.  though that may be true, it's a shame that we don't perceive reality to be the real truth. richard"
"August 14, 2014  3:56PM",abacomike," when i awoke this morning at 600 pdt, i emailed my mercedes-benz benz dealer and asked if he would kindly email me back a copy of the 2015 e400 they ordered for me along with a copy of the ordering guide for the e400.  i just received all the info from him. i do not know if there are major differences between the u.s. bound e400's and the canadian bound e400's, but if you have any quesitons about ""standard"" and optional equipment and u.s. pricing, i'd be more than happy to oblige.  i know the car they ordered is due to be built on september 12th and is due to arrive at the dealership about 5 weeks later.  the msrp on the car is $69,990.00 including transportation.  i know you got the 4-matic, which is usually about $2500 more than the rear wheel drive version. i saw the color you ordered, ""diamond silver metallic"", a year or so ago on one of the car he had in inventiory.  yes, it has just a hint of blue in the hue, but mostly silver - excellent choice.  i just prefer the light gray. it would appear that you got a great price, driver - getting 4% off msrp on a brand new model is not an easy task - and you will be one of the first to own a 2015 in canada, that's for sure.  most dealers do not budge on car when they first arrive as a new model.  that new engine should be great - improved economy with 26 more horsepower - how good it that?  i have a twin turbo on my current car and there is no lag or hesitation at all when ""kicking"" it down. when you get your new car, you should join the mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz club of canada.  in canada, after 1 year full membership, you can print out a coupon for $1000 off on your next mercedes-benz benz.  here in the u.s., it's only $500."

"August 14, 2014  5:00PM",bwia," no pope mobile but... would you believe when the pope arrived in south korea today his conveyance of choice was a kia soul? koreans who are so status conscious could not believe their eyes, that the eminence would ride in a soul. (pun not intended) well, it was not a stunt, as the pope is a genuinely humble man. at the vatican he runs around in a ford focus, what humility. i know he took a vow of poverty but there ought to be limits placed on modesty and humility. would anyone care to speculate what the pope would ride in when he visits the u.s. or canada?  an cadillac perhaps? i think not."
"August 14, 2014  5:01PM",laurasdada," yes, gg, the 8500.  i was going to buy a panachevrolet vt, but poof!  they went away... shopping for a stand for the darlin'.  the one i picked out, made (in the usa!) from reclaimed wood  with drawers, side cabinets, covered wire management holes and a unique finish (the beginning of my ""eclectic"" furniture collection!), well, i guess i have good taste.  not available until halloween!  so, do i wait, maybe buy an ikea interim thing or move on...  first world problem continue to haunt me. the true picture of the plasma, rich blacks, along with the motion representation sold me.  i watched a baseball game, side by side, plasma and 4k led.  grounder to short, shortstop scoops, throws and... for a second there are two baseballs on their way to first on the led!  not so on the plasma.  tax free weekend in ma, so a bit of a savings there."

"August 14, 2014  5:46PM",driver100," i had good intentions but i never actually made it to the caddie dealer, the jag dealer, or the bmw dealer.  i guess you haven't caught up in all the posts yet or you would know. btw...nice to have you back for now. i did try the audi, and when we got to the mercedes-benz benz dealer, which we thought was a long shot to begin with, we were surprised to find it was exactly what we were looking for.  you know when you put a suit on and it just feels right...little things that are hard to explain. i like large windows to get a sense of light, seat go high to get a high position, the feel of the road but a little softer ride, elegant with styling that is to our taste. i could have kept looking, and at one time i would have tried them all, but, i really don't think i could find a car that suited us.  i think the fact we moved quickly helped us get the good deal too....the salesman had us before we could change our mind."
"August 14, 2014  5:55PM",sterlingdog," driver, congratulations on a beautiful purchase.  i know that you will enjoy it.  it's a fine automobile. richard"
"August 14, 2014  5:57PM",driver100," now that you mention it, he ran down the price and options, and subtracted the trade, added in extras.  he gave me what i was hoping to get for the trade in, and then i said, well if you can take 4% off which bmw and audi did for us in the past, you will have sold a car.  he hesitated, and then he said i can do that. like i just wrote to richard, i think he sensed i wasn't there to b.s., he had me in the showroom ready to sign, and if he messed it up at that point they could lose the sale.  there's another dealer 20 minutes away. that $69990 price is interesting.  mine was based on a 2014 e350, but will stay at 4% off whatever the price happens to me.  the e350 was $66800 and they all have awd here. they can hold out for full msrp on a new one, but, i would just shop until i found a dealer who will give me the discount.....might not find one but i think someone would rather make 4% and get the service work than get nothing - besides, it was a very easy sale from someone ready to buy."

"August 14, 2014  7:55PM",fezo, richard - the other thing people don't realize about convertibles is that some of the best rides in them are at night.  nothing against the sun - it's my favorite star - but rides under the stars are great. today i had the great misfortune to see a jeep wrangler in that same orange as that dodge.  talk about eyeslaughter.  fortunately on my way home it was on my blind side.  i was never so grateful for the mostly useless eye.
"August 14, 2014  8:20PM",driver100," thanks richard.  i asked the audi salesman about the cadillac cts and he said it is a great car, it will have more gadgets on it than you will know ever existed.  he said it is a great car and you will save $10 to $15k, but, it just won't feel quite the same.  depends on how important that is. all the other things he said seemed to be true, so i believed him.  still, i would have liked the chance to try the caddie and jag, but a bird in the hand.............."
"August 14, 2014  8:28PM",driver100," the packages are different here.  i got the premium pkge but that gives me blind spot, lane track, choice of wood or aluminum trim, harmon kardon sound and surround camera i think. i can't get a copy of the options, only the dealer has it.  i also got the wooden steering wheel with a flat bottom.  i don't need a car that stops when the cruise is on, or that parks itself, etc. i'll know more when they publish the actual list."

"August 15, 2014  2:09PM",bwia," auto tech just thought i'd share this tidbit. panachevrolet which was once well known for its affordable tvs and cheap audio gear has raised the bar and is now a major player in the auto tech industry. i saw a recent tv commercial which prompted me to check out their their boastful tech know-how. it would appear that they have an impressive number of auto companies in their portfolio. ford and mylink, hyundai and uconnect, acura and els; and volkswagen and fender. still, they have plans to join forces with tesla to produce a new battery. which begs the question, why would an auto company try to develop its own telematics when it can partner with a tech company that already has that expertise and capability? by the way, jaguar and land rover vehicles were recalled due to a faulty passenger side airbag problem. isn't ford the jag's airbag supplier?"
"August 15, 2014  2:18PM",fezo, last i looked panachevrolet was going out of regular consumer products all together and getting into things like what you describe.  a business service company. a shame to me because their consumer products were very good to spectacular.

"August 15, 2014  9:42PM",ab348," speaking of ford, yet another recall on the ford, and also the focus st. from automotive news detroit -- ford motor co. has issued its 11th recall on the 2013 ford crossover, this time because a wiring problem could cause the engine to hesitate or stall. the recall covers 159,395 ford and focus st hatchbacks from the 2013 and 2014 model years with turbocharged 2.0-liter engines in north america. ford said the engine wiring harnesses may have “splices that were insufficiently compressed during the supplier manufacturing process,” which can affect engine performance by sending incorrect signals to the powertrain control module. the defect could result in problem including stalling, reduced engine power, hesitation or ilchevrolettion of the engine-malfunction indicator light, ford said. no injuries or crashes are linked to the problem. dealers are being instructed to replace the wiring splices. flaws that other recalls on the ford have addressed include fluid leaks that could cause an engine fire, doors that can open while the vehicle is moving and rollover airbags that may not deploy quickly enough."

"August 15, 2014 11:40PM",driver100," speaking of ford, there was a good article about the 2015 lincoln lincoln....how could anyone remember that name.  it was written by david booth, and says the lincoln is just a tarted up ford, though there are some good things about it. btw...this is a good article to read to understand the concept of ""feel of the road"". here are some comments at random oh, to be sure, the push-button transmission thing is an arriviste’s attempt at class (not to mention a blatant rip-off of ford’s yesteryear) and i still find the sync system’s graphics a little cheap. buy into the ecoboost myth because ford’s turbocharging augments performance if you must, but only a fool would believe that you’ll also conserve gasoline. but the steering still feels more isolated than a north korean dictator. you know you’re in control because the horizon tilts less when you attack corners, but there’s so little feedback through the wheel that you don’t know whether the economy is really booming or you just ran over a scurry of innocent squirrels. as much as lincoln has balanced the ride and handling equation, driving the lincoln still feels a little video-game-ish; your mind manages the direction through visual cues but there’s absolutely no tactile feedback. that said, it probably doesn’t matter much to the average crossover buyer; acura’s mdx feels equally disassociated and it has remained a best-seller for years. lincoln’s brand is so thoroughly tarnished that really good and solid are simply not strong enough adjectives to start getting people out of their audis. full article at;"
"August 15, 2014 11:47PM",imidazol97, odd they have the car listed and have a vin but the ford dealer does not have this or any 2015 ford in their inventory.

"August 16, 2014  1:10AM",oldfarmer50, i think the worst thing lincoln did was to abandon the traditional names for the letters.  i can't tell a lincoln from a lincoln or an lincoln.  caddy does the same thing. when i heard eldorado or lincoln i could visualize a specific car.  now it's just alphabet soup.

"August 16, 2014  1:47AM",driver100," i think david booth liked the ford and he found many good things he liked about the lincoln as well.  he didn't cut up the ford or lincoln, and i can't give any opinion since i know nothin.  from what i know and see i like them both........but, both car don't have ""the feel of the road"" many of us are looking for.  not a problem if you are one of the 80% of drivers who don't find that to be important."
"August 16, 2014  1:48AM",driver100, spokes would be nice too!
"August 16, 2014  1:51AM",driver100," i was wondering about that too.  i doubt if they have the car in stock since they haven't really shipped it seems.  my guess is she or he....whoever katey is, has ordered the car but hasn't actually got it yet.  maybe even testing the waters to see what he/she can get for it."
"August 16, 2014  2:24AM",Mr_Shiftright," the big three, or 2.5, still doesn't get it. when you tarnish or cheapen or debase a brand or product name, you can never restore it to former glory  (see cadillac, lincoln, imperial, packard, thunderbird). exception  ford did make a comeback, but it was never a luxury or prestigious vehicle."
"August 16, 2014  9:21AM",oldfarmer50," don't laugh but when i bought the lincoln it had a couple of white walls still on it. i thought they kind of looked good. i might have completed the set if white walls weren't so rare these days. the vinyl roof however, is ugly as sin. i am planning on visiting the dealer wearing plaid pants pulled up to my chest just to confuse them."
"August 16, 2014  9:27AM",oldfarmer50," driver, katey is a town in texas."

"August 16, 2014 12:16PM",driver100," i was just looking at that picture of the lincoln again and i was thinking, how did they find that particular field to park it.  they must have found an electical field grid that services half of the country....check behind the car."
"August 16, 2014 12:21PM",bwia," for some reason the domestics believe the alpha numeric nomenclature enhances the prestige of the brand but the opposite is true. that works for the pontiac because it differentiates them as european brands and as such charged and received premium prices for their products. the d3 justified this branding approach arguing it is easier to emphasize the brand than the model thus creating a halo effect. no matter how mediocre a model it would benefit from the brand name.  yea right. ask acura about the legend to acura debacle. by the way, cadillac has introduced a crest-less ats coupe to help pick up the sales slide in the ats four sedan which is down 21% this year. as a result they will, or have stopped production for three weeks to help dealers move their bloated inventories."
"August 16, 2014 12:26PM",driver100," good theory but not so sure it is completely correct.  hyundai came back after the pony and in particular old hyundai weren't very good. pretty successful now. gm tried bringing back the firenza.name, i think they were both disasters.   maybe that proves your point. i think ford could bring back the thunderbird and they could have a big hit on their hands.  luxury car market is growing, and people would probably love a 4 door, 4 seater, luxury type car.  then again, the people who bould want to buy it, won't be able to get in or out of it....especially the backseat. there are probably a few others that made it back.  cadillac certainly did, they are selling really well."
"August 16, 2014  2:34PM",driver100," interesting theory.  i think numbers or letters can sound more luxurious, but, they have to be the right combinations.  i always liked the galaxie xl.  it sounds like excel and is easy to remember.......lincoln or lincoln hmm, not so much.  i guess mk is supposed to stand for mark. you mentioned the ats sales being down this year.  cadillac sales are down a bit overall, but they are selling fewer fleet car (not sure which company buys fleets of caddies besides mary kay) and more single sales. very interesting article at cnbc(even if it is left wing propoganda)"
"August 16, 2014  2:48PM",imidazol97, ...and there is a refresh coming with the 2015 ats. i suspect some may be waiting for the new models. i was reading the wiki information about the ats. i note that it outsold cla and the audi. that has to be a positive indicator. was behind a black ats at a busy stop sign with windows down. the sound of that motor was exciting as that driver zipped out  between rush hour goin' home traffic and accelerated.
"August 16, 2014  3:24PM",roadburner," cadillac has a continuing problem with their pricing; while the ats and cts are very competitive with their european counterparts the public perception of the cadillac brand has yet to reach that lofty pinnacle. the suits at cadillac reason ""we're in the same ballpark as audi/bmw/m-b, we should be able to set our prices hondaingly."" unfortunately, the typical customer in that segment tends to think ""why buy a cadillac when i can buy an audi/bmw/m-b for similar money?"" we were in a somewhat similar position in 2005; buy a 16k mile cpo 2004 x3 with 84k miles and five years of warranty remaining or buy a new ford or nissan for the same money- or a new cadillac for a few grand <em>  more </em> . yeah, that was a tough call... the result is that cadillac has to offer big rebates or aggressive lease rates, etc., to move their product- thereby devaluing the prestige of brand to some extent. me, i'd price the car where they would sell and still make a profit, and gradually build up the brand equity. unfortunately, the suits at gm(like most of the execs in the automobile industry) are much like the people i have dealt with in state and local government; their idea of long-range planning is deciding what they are going to have for lunch..."
"August 16, 2014  3:28PM",roadburner," well, yes and no; the ats is aimed at the audi/3 series/c class segment; the cla and audi are one rung down."
"August 16, 2014  3:44PM",abacomike," you mentioned that the ats outsold the cla - i would hope so, imid.  the cla, imho, was a very big mistake for mb.  their market research, i believe, was incorrect.  ask a person if they would rather buy a mb or a cadillac for the same or less money.  their response would be mb, i suspect, however if you asked them would you rather buy a downsized, downscaled mb or a cadillac ats.  i suspect the response would be quite different. i've seen and driven both car and the cadillac is a far superior product when compared to the mercedes-benz benz cla. the new c class has received rave reviews from what i have read over the past few weeks.  that new engine (3.0 l, 329 hp, 340 torque) is a screamer, to be sure, and is the same engine that is in the new 2015 e400 mercedes-benz benz. if cadillac would bring out a redesigned cts and ats that is a departure from current styling and more in line with sleeker lines, etc., cadillac would compete nicely with any luxury brand out there.  but the cadillac styling on its ats/cts is a bit worn out, don't you agree?"
"August 16, 2014  4:04PM",Mr_Shiftright," ah, i didn't state my theory clearly enough. i was referring more to prestigious brands that were deliberately downgraded by the company in order to either boost sales or pursue some other marketing illusion.  it's hard to make a comeback once you've done that. on the other hand, if you initially produce a crummy product, but then improve your brand name (gee, think subaru, jaguar, et al), you can definitely change the game in your favor. but if jaguar had re-badged a hillman and put the big cat on the hood, that would have been the end. fortunately they didn't, and also fortunately, ford bought them and got them out of the british motor car loony bin."
"August 16, 2014  5:05PM",jayrider, if you like galaxie xl --- how about a galaxie 500 xl.  my dad bought a new 65 coupe with a 390 new. the 64's actually look much nicer and fetch a premium on the classic car market.
"August 16, 2014  5:27PM",driver100, we had a 65 regular galaxie 500 four door sedan....with bench seat.  i talked my dad into getting a 64 galaxie 500 with bucket seat and he said it was killing his back...traded it in on the 65 which he loved. a 65 galaxie 500 xl with a 390 sounds good to me.
"August 16, 2014  5:28PM",driver100, lol.....got it now.  i would have to agree completely...good point.  that's why you are the boss.
"August 16, 2014  5:46PM",jayrider, &gt; i had a great time driving my grandpa's 61 hillman minx. lot's of road feel and looking back at the flimsy nature of the build-- even a small accident would mean serious injury or death. those were the days.
"August 16, 2014  6:57PM",abacomike," <strong>  car shopping in the desert? </strong> when my son's so found out i was in the car business, she asked me if i would help her buy a new car while i am out here and have some spare time.  i said of course i'd help.  she currently drives a jaguar xj, about 3 years old, and she wanted something a little more comfortable in the rear for her two kids as they are getting bigger.  from what we discussed, it sounded like she did not want a mercedes-benz benz or an audi, but was interested in a lexus ls460, with or without the ""l"" (longer) body. so we went over to the lexus dealer and test drove both of them, the regular and the l.  for the money and the fact that it is the end of the model year, she preferred the regular sedan over the l. i had looked up her car on manheim and when their first offer came back, they were light about $2000 on her trade, which is to be expected.  the car was a dark maroon (matador red) with saddle (flaxen) perforated leather, walnut wood, and quite loaded, msrp was $83,719.  i researched the invoice on the car and it was $79,900 and i assumed there was trunk money available due to the new models coming out in a few weeks.  so brought the trade value up another $2000 and offered them $1400 behind invoice on the car, or $78,500 to be exact.  well, that did not sit well with the salesman, so he goes to the manager who comes out and ""cries"" that i am asking him to sell her a car for less than he paid for it.  i said, ""yes"".  he said he could not do it. i countered by stating that he had 10 ls460's out there, all loaded like this one, and mentioned that ls buyers usually don't buy red or close to red car with saddle interiors.  he said he couldn't do it. so, we left and went out for breakfast..  while we are eating, my son's so get a call on her cell phone that they would do the deal for $78,950 less her trade, which remained the same as i had requested.  she looked all excited and when she was about to tell him she would take the deal, i stopped her and said, ""no""!  i told her to tell him we are at $78,500, and not a penny more.  she told him what i requested and, of course, the manager accepts the deal. she dropped me off at the house, and my son and his so went over to finish signing paperwork etc.  i haven't heard from them, so i am assuming everything went well. the car is a gift from her parents so there won't be any funny business in the finance dept. with rates or fees.  but they seem to deal out here just as they deal back home.  what can i say."
"August 16, 2014  7:07PM",driver100," my mother had a 56 hillman californian that i learned to drive on, and took my drivers test in. probably not quite the same but this is about a 61; i remember the transmission worked in reverse.  they were part of the rootes group.  cute little things!"
"August 16, 2014  7:10PM",stickguy, 10 of a low volume model on the lot when the next year is rolling out means dealing no matter where you are.
"August 16, 2014  7:31PM",jayrider," yep the shifting was ""foreign"" and i have to say that i smoothed out the transmission by grinding the edges of most of the gears.  i have no idea where he bought it and as far as parts and warranty concerns -- must not have been on his mind."

"August 16, 2014  8:30PM",Mr_Shiftright," i have a fondness for crappy british car of the 60s and 70s. they are just so....quaint...and eccentric. back then, rootes and bl and bmc (who can remember who became what and when?) had no concept of fit and finish and interior trim. the imp, the stag, the marina---one disaster after another. and the strikes and the mediocrity of the management....ay, ay, ay....no wonder the germans rolled right over them in the marketplace. i think the brits woke up when rolls royce went bankrupt in '71. that was scary."
"August 16, 2014 10:06PM",abacomike,
"August 17, 2014 12:38AM",driver100," &gt; way to go mike!  they say salesmen are the easiest people to sell to, since you are selling all the time salespeople don't like to give other salesmen a hard time.  you weren't a pushover. i think you had the situation sized up pretty good.  ten car to get rid of and this particular one would be slow.  like the audi salesman said to me, you can get a good deal on last years models when the new ones come out, they don't want to lease 2014s right now.  if, you have cash that is king...you got real bargaining power."
"August 17, 2014 12:41AM",driver100," i had a 1960 sprite, gutless, no trunk, burned through a gallon of oil a week.  but it was fun! amazing what we can put up with when we were younger."

"August 17, 2014 12:59AM",Mr_Shiftright," the mgb was the best british car e-v-e-r, in terms of reliability, cost to own, and fun factor for the buck. i almost cried when i went to the movies one day and saw james bond driving a toyota 2000gt. i was ill for a week."

"August 17, 2014  1:59AM",stickguy, close enough.
"August 17, 2014  2:01AM",driver100," &gt; wow!  and i thought i bought a car in record time.  i had to try sitting in the 550 and though it is beautiful the salesman advised against it because we carry other people around so often. you got a great deal almost trading even, and with the savings on gas, tires and insurance you will probably come out ahead of the game. what colors? congratulations, i hope you enjoy it....i can't imagine a car being more perfect."

"August 17, 2014  1:03PM",imidazol97, orange that looks nice. i could taste an orange when near the car.
"August 17, 2014  2:08PM",stever, seemed brighter. maybe the snap of mine was taken with fuji film or something.
"August 17, 2014  2:27PM",driver100," that sounds about right...i just wonder who's will come off the line first. they may be built on a different day or shift, there could be small differences in equipment...so they probably run all the ones the same at the same time i just got the first package.  the extra package stops the car if someone walks in front, and it parks itself i guess.  i like my car turning me on but i don't want it to drive itself."
"August 17, 2014  2:36PM",imidazol97, heavy overcast. i did some paintshoppro on it.
"August 17, 2014  2:48PM",driver100," i got an email from my famous sil last night.  you know the one, the guy who tells me the sunroof stopped working on the car he bought from me 7 years ago and is now 10 years old, like as if it is under warranty still.  and, he bought it from the dealer anyway, not directly from me. so, i get an email like this; do you know someone with a lawn mower i can borrow.  mine broke down and all our neighbours have a service. this is typical sil.  if my lawn mower broke down on saturday at 430 i would race over to a store, spend $150, and get a new one, you will need one anyway.  why borrow one and pick it up and take it back, and then end up buying one anyway?  it's what he always does, never gets things fixed until they fall apart and then he tries to borrow....and when he borrows he forgets to give it back or he breaks it and has to buy two new ones. the 10 year old bmw has 150k miles on it.  our daughter has a responsible job that pays very well, and she drives about 60 miles to work and back each day.  he'll keep that car going until it completely falls apart.  i would rather buy a $25 or $30k honda, toyota, fusion, sonata, get a warranty, and be reasonably certain i wouldn't get stuck on a highway with a major breakdown. just two different ways of thinking."
"August 17, 2014  2:51PM",driver100," that's when i liked my convertible the best too...on a mild evening.  but, once a giant bird flew over when the top was down on one of those beautiful evenings.  i got the largest deposit from a bird i have ever seen...must have been rodan, and it hit the windshield thank goodness.  if that bird had been one foot over i would have needed a shower for a week."
"August 17, 2014  3:00PM",henryn," &gt; ahh, one of my very best memories! 1970 dodge convertible, with a freshly built 340 small block.  headers feeding into a true dual exhaust with turbo style mufflers.  the car had a really, really nice rumble to it. late at night, driving back from freeport (on the coast, beach town) to houston on old highway 288 (2 lane blacktop in those days).  top down, really nice, full moon.  the exhaust would echo back at me every time i passed a farmhouse, barn or other structure.   there was no other traffic, it was past midnight on a week night.  occasionally i would drop down to 30 or 40 mph, and do a full throttle run up to 70 or 80 mph, just to feel the acceleration and hear that exhaust roar."
"August 17, 2014  3:02PM",houdini1," great story mike. i am on my second ls and have never had any issues. that is this car's strong suit. good looking comfortable car and everything works....for a long, long time."
"August 17, 2014  3:09PM",houdini1," yep, sounds like that dealer threw ol"" brier mike right into the brier patch !!"
"August 17, 2014  3:21PM",driver100," a few things about that oldf.  briefly, here is how i see it.  subtract price of trade in from new car and divide by 3 years the 535 cost me $11k a year to drive.  not cheap, but.... a ford fusion that could be $30k new will be worth about $15k in 3 years or cost $5k a year to own.    so, these car cost about $6k a year more.  that is about the cost of a good bottle of wine a day, 10 or 12 beers a day, the cost of running a motor boat, the cost of playing volkswagen a few times a week, or going on a nice trip each year.  depends on what's important, and not implying you drink 10 or 12 beers a day. some people find it hard to spend money.  i talked to a guy this week who has over $1million, but he drives an old civic.  he doesn't buy anything he doesn't need.  he grew up during the war in england and won't spend money he doesn't have to.  i can understand that, but, it seems a shame, to have that money in the bank when he may enjoy a newer car.  i guess there is a balance. finally, i used to agonize for a year too before buying a car.  then i would stay awake at nights wondering how i would pay for the car if i lost my job.  i always tried to be ahead in payments so the car was worth more than the amount owing on it. life can be difficult."
"August 17, 2014  3:22PM",abacomike," brr'r mike seems to enjoy being in the ""briar"" patch - he has but one weakness, which is saying a lot - <strong>  new car </strong> !!!  what can i say - it's definitely a ""sickness"", to be sure!  but i only buy one car a year - some of our regular posters here buy 2, and sometimes 3."
"August 17, 2014  3:24PM",driver100, you're the guy roaring past and waking oldfarmer up in the night.
"August 17, 2014  3:25PM",abacomike," thanks for your concerns and reservations, bwia, however i have bought every mercedes-benz benz from that dealer the exact same way.  i have ordered 3 of the car i bought and all of the purchases were as smooth as silk - he never tried to ""stick it to me"" on any of those car or any that i bought out of his inventory."
"August 17, 2014  3:32PM",abacomike," when i sold lexus vehicles, there was only 1 model that was truly superior in ever way imaginable - and that was the ls430.  it was comfortable, handled well, had enough power for almost every situation, room in the back seat as well as the front seat, big trunk, etc., etc., etc. as for the ls460, imho i believe they ""lowered"" the chassis a bit too much to suit me.  that is one of the complaints i have about the cls550 - too low.  yes, i can raise it about 4 inches, but in that position, it rides very, very hard, so i don't raise it very often. my son's so is truly in love with her new car.  when she told her parents how much she saved off msrp, her parents didn't believe her at first.  their comment was, ""...even if mike was in the business, no one buys car below invoice!""  that's the response dealerships love to hear - a customer who expects to pay a few thousand over invoice.  when i told her father what i paid for my cls550, he downright did not believe me.  i made him a believer yesterday, though!"
"August 17, 2014  3:39PM",abacomike," well, as we all know, your sil is not a pauper - so i guess we have to call his way of thinking ""rules for cheap people who want to sponge off others.""  on the other hand, there is your way of thinking, ""...rules for people who have no second thoughts about spending money!"" me, i always have second thoughts about spending money.  in fact, i have third, fourth, fifth, sixth and, at times, even seventh thoughts about spending money.  unfortunately for me, all of them are just one second apart from each other.  what i have to work on is counting to 23 trillion by ""ones"" before buying a new car.  but if i did that, i would always say, ""...boy, it's easier to just buy a new car than do all that counting!"""
"August 17, 2014  4:05PM",Mr_Shiftright," i remember once a lecture given by some tv money guru, and he said something very interesting ""you can tell how an individual regards money by watching how he actually handles it in his pocket or wallet""."
"August 17, 2014  4:47PM",houdini1," i owned a 2006 ls 430 and loved it also. while i think my current ls 460 is superior in most ways, there are certain things about the 430 that i liked better. for one, the size of the 430 was perfect for me. it was not a very big car, but big enough, and it was very maneuverable, with a tight turning radius. 2006 was the last year for that body style and it's biggest advantage was the excellent outward visibility. you could see all four corners. not so in the 460."
"August 17, 2014  5:27PM",henryn,"  i don't think i've ever owned a car that depriciated $15k in 3 years, but i do understand where you're going with this. having reached the age where i'm beginning to lose some of my friends to the grim reaper, i have a new found appreciation for enjoying life while i can."
"August 17, 2014  5:28PM",roadburner, if i had the extra coin i'd pick up this puppy just for cruising around...
"August 17, 2014  5:31PM",henryn,"  guilty as charged, but i think the statute of limitations has expired on this one.  this all occurred about 4 decades ago!"
"August 17, 2014  5:35PM",bwia," mike, for a minute there i thought you were the next larz anderson who reportedly bought a new car every year. but then gain larz married the wealthiest woman in america at the time. best of all he kept a fair number of the car that are on display at larz anderson auto museum in brookline, a tony suburb of boston . for those interested in history perhaps you will find this motor week video to be of interest. . and here is another link to the eclectic car collection enjoy!"
"August 17, 2014  6:52PM",houdini1," to me, that car would fit oldfarmer to a t, and he could get it for a lot less than the $35 big ones he plans on spending on the 'stang."
"August 17, 2014  7:22PM",imidazol97, here's a thunderbird color i'd forgotten
"August 17, 2014  8:32PM",explorerx4, . is that picture from the woodward dream cruise? the edge is probably a lost tourist.
"August 17, 2014  8:37PM",abacomike,
"August 17, 2014  9:34PM",oldfarmer50, that actually looks good. i almost got this color eclipse.
"August 17, 2014  9:38PM",driver100," 2005 lexus 430. i like these, nice big windows and squared off.  they did their homework well copying a 2000 mercedes-benz benz."
"August 17, 2014  9:39PM",oldfarmer50, driver100  just two different ways of thinking. did he grow up poor? that's typical thinking of someone who comes from an impoverished background. i never had much money and it killed me to give up a car until it was total trash.
"August 17, 2014  9:42PM",driver100, it seems larse kept every car he bought....mike at least trades his in.
"August 17, 2014  9:42PM",oldfarmer50, can you imagine what that car would be worth today?
"August 17, 2014  9:44PM",imidazol97," yes. 3 sets of pictures on this wxyz link. lots of complaining about anyone's being able to drive up and down woodward among the true classic car. the regular folks like the edge  clog up the scenery. you can only see a few classics in this shot, e.g.. i'd always had woodward cruise on my bucket list. after seeing these pictures--not so much."

"August 17, 2014 10:29PM",graphicguy," sales story (kind of).  was cutting grass this a.m.  hit what appeared to be a steel cable.  don't know where it cme from, nor what it would be used for.  it was braided with a vinyl cover.  anyway, it wrapped around the shaft and bent it.  tried to balance it.  tried to pound it straight.  no dice. so, figuring new blades, new deck, new shaft, new belt....about $700....give or take. off to lowes. they seem to always have mowers lined up in front of their stores.  looking cheap, figuring if that's all it takes to cause $700 in damage, better buy the cheapest mower amnd hope for 5 years of service. looking for a $900 special, don't care about brand. there was a deere in front with a $1,100 price tag....cheap for a deere (retail $1,899).  it wasn't the base model. it wasn't entry level either.  it was a d130....42"", 22hp, automatic. grtting to the point, it was a return (looked new to me).  had 4 hiurs on the meter.  guy couldn't fit in the seat (yikes). they waved the delivery charge.  5% off if i opened a lowes charge card. done deal. we'll see if john deere mowers live up to their farm equipment reputation."
"August 17, 2014 10:36PM",abacomike,
"August 17, 2014 10:49PM",oldfarmer50, hate to tell you but almost all cheap mowers sold at big box stores regardless of brand are made by mtd in michigan.  only difference is the paint. the good john deere mowers are at the john deere dealer. they don't cost a 1000 bucks. i have a bolens paint job and it has mowed 5 acres for about 5 years now which is a surprise to me. got off to a slow start because lowe's delivered it without blades.
"August 17, 2014 10:59PM",houdini1," they must have copied it very well and made some improvements. a 2005 base mercedes-benz benz  430 s class had an msrp of about $92,000. a 2005 base lexus ls 430 had a msrp of about $56,000. today, hondaing to edmunds, that  2005 s class has a retail value of $10,663. and the 2005 lexus ls 430 has a retail value of $15,769. now that's incredible !! i assumed 90,000 miles on each vehicle."
"August 17, 2014 11:13PM",nyccarguy, there is something about those.  just the v8 burble when cruising around with the windows open on a summer night is worth the price of admission;)
"August 17, 2014 11:21PM",driver100," geez, they even copied the name! it is a big difference in price difference, but, that is probably the nicest looking lexus ever made."
"August 17, 2014 11:24PM",driver100," gg congratualations on the new set of wheels. also, i think it is the first time we have talked about riding mowers....so double congrats. don't worry about what the others say, if it says john deere on it it should ride like a deer."

"August 18, 2014  1:19AM",houdini1," the john deere riding mowers sold at hd and lowe's are made by john deere at their plant in tenn. always have been. john deere dealers sell the exact same mowers plus more expensive ones as well. if you ever have to have it serviced you will have to take it to a jd dealer. mtd most likely makes some of the others but not john deere. congrats jj, you got yourself a great deal and a real jd. if you buy this tractor new from a jd dealer it will cost you $1900."
"August 18, 2014  2:46AM",graphicguy," houdini....yeah, it said right on the mower ""built by john deere in tn"".   i have heard mtd makes a lot of mowers for different brands, but deere does their own. mike....i had a wheelhorse for about 15 years.  served me well.  3 years ago i bought a husqvarna because of the reputation of their power tools.  it was never the equal of my wheehorse.  but toro consumer riding mowers abre tough to find around here these days.  today was just icing on the cake. i hope the deere is better."
"August 18, 2014  3:22AM",sterlingdog," since i can't decide what i want in a new car, perhaps i should buy a john deere and ride it around town.  would they give me a discount if i ordered one without blades?  if they still come in two tone green and yellow, i would be a happy camper.  i like those colors together.  i could buy a matching umbrella to use when it rains.  wonder what the gas mileage is? richard"
"August 18, 2014  3:32AM",henryn," john deere makes good equipment, no question about that.  i have owned a couple of their riding mowers / garden tractors.  but if you're buying something just to cut large amounts of grass, you really, really, really should look into a ztr.  you will be amazed at how much quicker you will get the job done.  truly amazed."
"August 18, 2014  3:33AM",henryn," re 1970 dodge 340 convertible &gt; yes, i can imagine.  and believe it or not, the car was given to me.  a man i worked with had it stored in his garage, in non-running condition.  he had paid some amateur mechanic to rebuild the engine.  my co-worker wanted his garage space back, and i offered to pay him a few hundred.  he told me i could have it for free if i promised to ""fix it up nice"", as it was the first car that he ever owned. the passenger side head was cracked.  when i tore the engine down, i found where the amateur mechanic had installed a freeze plug in one of the water passages directly behind the water pump.  i rebuilt the engine, bought a new set of tires and mag wheels, and was saving up for a new paint job when some idiot ran over me and totaled the car. oh, well."
"August 18, 2014  4:00AM",graphicguy," i don't have quite an acre.  plus, the ztrs cost more than i'm willing to spend.  appreciate the advice, though!"

"August 18, 2014 10:55AM",venture," i am the groundskeeper at a baseball field and we use only john deere tractors. we currently have an x300 ($3000) and an x730 ($11,000). the x300 we use to mow in tight areas like the bull pens and around the buildings. the x730 is used to mow the outfield and sidelines. of course, they are both used to pull things such as a de-thatcher, spreader, field drag, and various trailers. we look hard when buying new equipment and have found the best value by using john deere. the initial cost is a little higher, but overall we feel we are saving money. we use them hard and need the dependability also."

"August 18, 2014 11:33AM",oldfarmer50," after research i withdraw my comment about john deere tractors.  turns out they are the only one who still make their own. mtd makes most of the rest, however. switching topics, have any of you looked at this ""active under steer control"" that nissan touts?  it seems to apply the inboard brake in turns to increase yaw and thus rotate the car through turns. fascinating concept if it works.  is nissan the only one that does this?"

"August 18, 2014  5:48PM",abacomike," interesting question, oldfarmer.  so i called my usaa bank because they advertise special rates if you buy a new car and are a member of usaa.  their 36 month loan rate on $15,000+ is 1.38% ""less"" .8% as a discount at the end of the loan if you use their buying service, or a ""net"" apr of .58% (less than 1%). so i asked them how could they possibly do that and lose money on these loans.  the guy responded that their buying service (tru-car) makes up the difference. i don't use their buying service because the dealer then has to sell me the car for $1000 over invoice, less the discounts which he recovers from mercedes-benz benz usa.  so it does not pay for me to use their buying service.  so if i borrow $15,000 for 36 months, i would pay an apr of 1.38%.  that is a phenominal rate. i just don't know how they do it, to be honest with you. the guy said i have been pre-approved for a loan for 36 months for up to $60,000.  all i have to do is call them a few days before the car is to be delivered to the dealership, give them the vin, electronically sign the loan papers, and they will send me an electronic check for the total amount of the loan which i turn over to the dealership, and which they will accept. amazing!!!"
"August 18, 2014  5:54PM",abacomike," as a postscript to my previous post, i do not intend to take out a loan at this time because i own my current car outright.  it has a value of about $62,000 in mid october when i will be trading it.  the invoice of the new car will be about $64,990 including transportation. subtract, on average $2500 for the usaa fleet incentive that mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz sponsors and another $500 for the mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz club of america incentive, or at total of $3000, and you end up with an even trade, give or take $500. it is nice finally not having car payments to worry about, even at those low rates, especially with the expenses i have incurred out here in california with outrageous air fare, food, rental car, etc."

"August 18, 2014  9:39PM",bwia," you should be worried. these auto loans are sold and then repackaged into other securities similar to the mortgage backed securities of a decade ago. in that pool are risky loans of up to 25% interest rate. don't know how the fed is going to handle it but that trillion dollar auto loan bubble is about to burst. i believe they have already called gm's ally to task for making risky and usurious loans. in the used car market the problem is even worse as consumers are trapped in high interest loans that they cannot repay. if you haven't already done so, now is the time to immunize your 401(k) against the next crash."

"August 19, 2014  9:22AM",oldfarmer50, of course you never know whether you'll achieve that. i've put  about 12k miles on my $900 farm van so that one worked out. i've put 10k on the $3200 lincoln so the jury is still out. i got 100k out of my $7000 chrysler which made it a winner. but i only got 10k out of another chrysler which cost $6850 before my kid totaled it. if i bought one of mike's $70k car i'd have to drive it for the next three generations.
"August 19, 2014 11:22AM",driver100," you may consider going with a 2014 e350 or 2015 e400.  i think the cost would be less, and it might be more practical, as mike found out.  i appreciate the comfort of the mb compared to the handling and performance of the bmw, as i get older. i think that interior is actually beige and black, or in the case of the car i got it is crystal grey (very light gray, almost white) with black trim.  we did get crystal blue exterior. if you really like the car just go to a dealer and sit in it.....my wife and i couldn't believe how beautiful and comfortable the car is.  if you do drive it you will know it feels solid, yet the steering and handling are superb. like i say, it will probably cost the same as a mainstream car, plus a package of cigarettes a day, bottle of wine a day, one or two games of volkswagen a week, etc also, a mercedes-benz benz lasts a long time and if you do low miles, it will last that much longer....i think this is a car you could keep for a long time, and it may even get better with age. at least sit in it and then decide....even if you don't buy one, it is worth the experience."
"August 19, 2014 11:29AM",driver100," i'll check the nissan too....but, only if i can convince him to go with a gas engine.  i think he likes the nissan because it is electric.  young people get me...they buy an electric car to save the planet but they leave lights and their computers on all day. i always liked the nissan.  i think that segment is so crowded now that manufacturers are falling over each other to get the best deal.  i see volkswagens for $200 a month too......but, i would only suggest a volkswagen to a person who is prepared to spend on maintenance when the warranty is up.  besides, if he is looking at a nissan  and he drives a 25 year old volvo, he doesn't need the ""feel of the road""."
"August 19, 2014 11:31AM",houdini1," mike, i read where the new c class has a longer wheelbase than the e class. could this be true?"

"August 19, 2014  2:48PM",mako1a," while i've never been shown the door, i have been ignored until i left. i had a new toyota toyota limited maybe 2 or 3 k miles and 2 months old. news on tv said all toyota have runaway acceleration. i was fine with the toyota, but my wife refused to go anywhere in the car. i took it to a mb dealer where he showed me a c class which i found underpowered and basically junk compared to the toyota. for some reason he had it in his mind that it was the c or nothing. they never gave me a trade value, kept asking what i owed on the toyota (nothing-i'm a cash buyer) and pretty much waited for me to like their car. i looked around the lot, found an s class that seemed to be my speed, but for some reason they didn't want to tell me a price difference remember, price was never mentioned. there was zero hostility, i just wanted to see a car i liked and some semblance of a semi-fair trade deal and i would have been a mb owner, as it is now, i wouldn't give 10 cents for a mb since my only experience was just that pitiful."
"August 19, 2014  3:01PM",ab348," certainly there is nothing available locally. the local dealer has one e series coupe in inventory, an e350 with the amg dressup package at the low, low list price of $73,000. it is black/black, my least favorite color combo so i have little interest. they have a dozen or so sedan, some e250 4-cyl diesels, the rest e300s and e350s. all except 1 or 2 have black interiors which is how this dealer (the same ownership group where i leased my buick) tends to order most of their car for stock. how my buick arrived with a cashmere interior must have been a mistake. realistically i won't be doing anything for a few months at least and most likely not until next spring so this is mostly academic for mow. i was surprised at the affordability of the lease payments though. gives me an option i really hadn't thought about before."
"August 19, 2014  4:41PM",graphicguy," mako....like you, i was never shown the door, but was ignored. i remember it well.  i was in the market for an is350 when they first came out.  went to the local lexus dealer.  found a beautiful grey one.  it was loaded with mark levinson, nav, all the gee gaws. as i'm want to do, i figured a price that allowed the dealer what i considered a good margin, since i took into account the car had just come out.  but, as i'm also want to do, it was an out the door price....taxes, tags, doc fees, everything. i presented it.  they countered.  i told them i was all in.  they came back with my number plus some irritating stuff like tire insurance, doc fees.  it added up to about $500 more than my ""one time"" offer. i told the slesperson again, ""i'm all in"".  he said he'd take it back to his manager to see if we could make a deal.  i waited, and waited, and waited, 15 minutes, 20 minutes. no sales person.  finally, i go to the receptionist to ask where my sales person went.  she said he went home for the day. what? i was livid.  i stormed out of the dealership.  wrote a letter to the dealership principal explaining what happened.  he called me.  apologized.  said he had seen my offer and they agreed to accept it. sales person calls back minutes later.  i asked him what the deal was leaving me hanging.  he was honest and said the deal was too skinny for him, but that the dealer prinicipal said he told him to accept it.  no sorry i left you at my desk while i went home.  no, ""hey, we can't do this deal, but thanks for coming in"". i told him i didn't want his deal, and to tell his dealer principal to call me to find out why. of course he didn't.  but, when the secretary to the dealer principal followed up with me a day later, i informed her of how poorly this lost deal went. not sure what happened after that.  i only started to go back into the lexus showrooms again just recently. they're all about making a deal, now."
"August 19, 2014  5:03PM",henryn," what exactly is a ""dealer principal""?"
"August 19, 2014  5:40PM",mako1a," gg, i guess sensitive guys like us need to prepare well for some callous dealings when trading car. like you, i don't need financing. i also go for the otd offer in most cases which makes the salesman little more than an errand boy in and out of the gm's office. no wonder they leave for the day without warning. all that training up in smoke. oh well ""it's only business""."
"August 19, 2014  5:42PM",oldfarmer50, i think it's the head of a school who sells drugs.

"August 19, 2014  5:58PM",graphicguy," dealer principal is the manager of all day to day functions over every dept of the dealership.  usually, but not neccessarily, the dealership's owner. mako...you've been around here a good long while.  you are knowledgeable, level headed and courteous.  to ignore you at a dealership seems like a travesty. sometimes i wonder if dealerships prefer customers who know absolutely nothing about buying a car vs someone who does research and has more experience?"
"August 19, 2014  6:10PM",mako1a, then again flip flops and shorts topped off with a steeler jersey may not be what mb dealerships are used to dealing with. lol
"August 19, 2014  6:45PM",henryn," thanks for the clarification, i had never seen the term before. many businesses have a “fake manager” or “pretend general manager” who does nothing but listen to angry customers.  i first encountered this at a ford dealership back around 1990, and i encountered it at a branch of chase bank in 2002.  it’s kind of obvious if you actually talk to the person, they generally know absolutely nothing about the actual business, their job is to just listen calmly until you vent all of your anger / frustration."
"August 19, 2014  8:20PM",driver100," 2014 chrysler sedan 2015 genesis maybe not the best pictures to compare but i have been out all day and wanted to get them off  quickly...you asked so nicely bwia. for the record, i find the 2014 audi audi  similar to; a 2014 mitsubishi mitsubishi;"

"August 19, 2014  8:27PM",jayrider," car shopping is much more relaxing when you go in expecting to be treated poorly. just smile, be respectful and focus on the numbers. if you are left waiting for more than 5 minutes get up and find out what's happening. if you can't agree on a price in an hour, just leave."
"August 19, 2014  8:36PM",driver100," mike, i wouldn't call trading a cl550 for an e400 a trade down...it is really just trading for what suits you. when i was a teenager i got my father to buy a 64 ford galaxie 500 xl.  he hated the ""bucket"" seat, which really bothered his back. he traded it in for a regualar 65 ford galaxie 500 sedan, and he loved that car, bench seat and all; more expensive doesn't necessarily mean the car is going to suit you  as well."
"August 19, 2014  9:07PM",oldfarmer50," we had a discussion back on the old stories board where several salespeople mentioned looking at a customer's watch to judge their worthiness.  rolex--good, timex--stroke. i've gone car shopping dressed one step down from a homeless person and had them make assumptions about my credit score that were wrong.  it was fun letting them know how wrong. i would have walked over that treatment."
"August 19, 2014  9:28PM",explorerx4," regarding electric car, they suit the driving habits of some people. a guy at work has a chevrolet and says he puts a few gallons in the tank every 4 months."
"August 19, 2014  9:51PM",jayrider, i could absolutely work with a total electric car for my in town driving. problem is that i drive so little that any gas savings would take decades to recoup after i take a beating trading in my toyota.
"August 19, 2014 10:23PM",cdnpinhead," as maynard said many decades ago, ""surely you jest.""  customers who know absolutely nothing are their bread and butter.  otoh, an informed buyer who has an otd number that they can live with can get a deal done in 15 minutes, as many of us know. but, i think we're rare."

"August 20, 2014  3:40PM",roadburner, back in 2000 or so i got really jacked around by the local audi dealer. we told them we were buying w/in the next week and they spent hour penciling a deal which was the advertised price for a cpo audi and $2000 back of book for my wife's car. the guy said to come back in a few days and the regular used car manager would be in and maybe they could do better. we drove straight over to the bmw dealer and my wife bought a  cpo bmw...
"August 20, 2014  4:50PM",oldfarmer50, you probably were wearing the wrong kind of watch.
"August 20, 2014  5:29PM",ab348," all right, that last part just needs more explanation. i've known the odd lady to smoke cigars, but a pipe?"
"August 20, 2014  5:43PM",stever," well, she did grow up in mississippi although she didn't smoke the appalachian corn cob pipe. she tried to quit smoking now and then and affected the pipe for a couple of years in an attempt to wean herself from the cigs, but only at home. didn't work but she finally quit in her late 70s following a six week rehab after a stroke. still doing okay at 92 and claims it's because she never inhaled (but i sure got a lot of second-hand stuff over the years)."
"August 20, 2014  5:47PM",abacomike,
"August 20, 2014  7:42PM",roadburner," the thing is, i had a friend who knew the owner of the audi dealer and he called and actually set up the appointment. i'd hate to see how the y treat somebody that walks in off the street. in contrast, i served on the bod of a local charity and another member was a very sweet elderly lady who had a son who owned a jeep dealership. i called her when i was hunting for a  used wrangler and she called her son- within 10 minutes a salesman called and said ""the owner mr xyz has told me to find you a great wrangler at a rock bottom price."" he did..."
"August 20, 2014  8:38PM",driver100," something to think about. i saw my friend who has the maserati, which he still loves, but he first bought a fiat 500 to get around in the winter, because the mas won't go in snow. then his wife thought the fiat was too unsafe, so he got a 2013 genesis, that was loaded for a good price, $38k cdn or about $34k us. he hates the genesis.  he says it has all the options, people love riding in it, but it is really boring.  he says it isn't worth much because the 2015s are much improved, so the value really sunk.  he is really getting interested in the mercedes-benz benz and he loves the idea of a v8 (which will be available in canada).  he says his wife won't let him get another car, but, that hasn't stopped him before. something to think about.  life is short, don't compromise, get what you really want if it is possible without getting into trouble."
"August 20, 2014  8:42PM",graphicguy," funny....i remember that long ago discussion. rb.....interestingly, i've tended to throw my business to dealerships who were willing to give the pencil some work when it comes to tradeins.  there are those, like you mentioned that seem to want the customer who has little clue as to what their trade is worth (or what they can buy the new car for, either). i have had plenty of ""maybe if i can get my manager to look at it again, we'll raise the trade number"".  i've always wondered, what did the manager miss the first time? what more does he really need to see to change his mind? the other one is ""we'll just wholesale your car....we have to deduct however much it costs to get it to the auction, pay the auction fees, etc.  i'm way back of book as a result"", to justify a low ball offer.  only to see it sitting in the front of their lot a day later for sale. then there are others that will state....""i need to make some money on the trade.  gg you take good care of your car.  i'll shine it up, but need to get a $1,000 more than i'm offering to make it work"".  fair enough.  i appreciate that sort of honesty.  you're giving me $15,000 for my trade.  you're (the dealer) going to be asking $17,000 on your lot...and turning it loose for $16,000.  that sort of honesty works for me. the other games i really don't respond to."
"August 20, 2014  9:20PM",qbrozen," i've only ever had the first situation happen (re-evaluating a trade). and only twice did was i ever given an honest justification. once was where they gave me good value because it was super clean, they loved the color, and wanted to keep it on their lot. the other was the gm plainly stating he was overallowing (alot) because he liked the car and really felt they could sell it for quite a bit (they didn't and it sat on their lot for months). when i've been lowballed, they've said things like ""we're just going to give it to a wholesaler"" but they've never attempted to explain what that means."
"August 20, 2014  9:21PM",bwia," <b>  can you return a new vehicle? </b> i would think not, but here is what prime auto says about its return policy. sales gimmick or honest desire to please the customer? ""every car at prime comes with prime peace of mind; a guarantee that if you weren’t satisfied with your purchase you can return the vehicle within 48 hours and get your money back without a hassle. and on used vehicles sold at a prime dealership, you can return your vehicle within 30 days or 750 miles and exchange it for a different vehicle of the same or greater value."" . and here is what a finance manager says about unwinding a sale ""it's an accounting nightmare,"" eleazer wrote. ""commissions need to be charged back, even if the month has already closed and everyone has been paid. your manufacturer's statement of origin must be retrieved from the dmv. affidavits must be executed to retain the vehicle's new-car status; if you don't, you've got a huge depreciation on your hands. and, finally, if a trade-in was involved, the payoff must be refunded by the bank and the title received on that trade returned."" i once bought a mattress with a return policy but there were so many conditions tacked on it that it was not worth the bother."
"August 20, 2014  9:47PM",fezo," don't know how i missed that miata.  i have been rather distracted of late. orange car alert.  local dodge dealer has a dodge in that same orange as the dodge.  no, thanks. now i'm not ocd at all but this drove me crazy.  driving home from another doctor appointment and there's a volkswagen in front of me with the volkswagen badge exactly upside down.  looked like some sort of genetic mutation.  like an m wearing a dunce cap."
"August 20, 2014  9:55PM",ab348, i think we need to add another truism to life don't buy a brand-new expensive car from a cheap brand.
"August 20, 2014  9:59PM",roadburner, note that this all goes back to having a certified nutjob for a wife.
"August 20, 2014 10:01PM",roadburner," that's the thing; i knew the auction price, and they were $2000 behind that. my bmw dealer gave me $3000 more, which made the more expensive cpo bmw look like a better deal compared to the audi."
"August 20, 2014 10:19PM",henryn," trade-ins are funny business.  you just never know where they’re going to fall.  the best bet is to get as much information as you possibly can, have qbrozen look up the recent auction numbers for you, and (if you can spare the time) go to carmax and get a solid offer from them. recently i was thinking of trading in my 2013 ford, and getting a new 2014.  go with the eco boost engine, get a few more options (back up camera, for one thing).  i found one i liked, got the price down to a fairly reasonable point, and asked them to evaluate my trade.  they came back at $21k.  i laughed , and tried to walk.  the sales manager came over and upped the offer to $24k.  i still walked, went straight to carmax, who made a solid offer to buy at $25,500. the $24k wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t very good either.  my ford should be worth at least as much to a ford dealer as it is to carmax.  but the starting offer was terrible, and i still feel like they were trying to ___ me.  which makes me much more likely to go to a different dealer the next time."
"August 20, 2014 11:20PM",driver100," not always the case.  the bmw dealer would only give us $20k on a trade-in for our 2008 335. some silly story about that is all they would pay if buying a similar one at the bmw auction.(sounded suspicious to me) the audi dealer gave us $24k with no hassle.  he said we don't have to give it a full warranty like bmw would.  he said i don't have to do anything to it, and i'll try to get $28k for it, but, even if i sell it for $25k, i'll make a quick $1000, and i'll convert someone to audi."
"August 20, 2014 11:22PM",driver100," yeh, it was all his wife's fault! (btw...she wanted to rid of the fiat when they did those last crash tests and the fiat didn't do too well)"

"August 21, 2014 12:27AM",roadburner," i remember you saying that a while back- hence the ""certified nutjob"" comment."
"August 21, 2014 12:28AM",stever," met a woman in tucson a decade ago who taught smoking cessation for a living. one thing stuck with me - a lot of the habit, at least for some, is the hand movement up to the mouth and back. you know, kind of like the habit some people fall into where they have to go chat up their car salesperson and inhale that new car smell every week or two."
"August 21, 2014  1:04AM",mako1a," check this out. i hadn't had a haircut in three months so in i go today. the shop, a mom and daughter place. mom is 65, daughter is 37. both very nice and honest to a fault. mom had a 2010 dodge dodge 5.7 hemi a/t she bought new. started having trans trouble in june, took it in for diagnosis. they told her it was a computer box behind the dash and would take 2 days and $800 to fix. she had bought many car from them over the years so went to the new car side and took a look at a 2014 dodge dodge 1500 4wd. she was a little upset with the deal (trading a non perfect running car), but accepted it and bought the red truck. it had adjustable pedals which she had set for herself after the test drive. they took the truck in for detail and put it out front for delivery. all ready to go home she starts it up. the truck takes off full speed squealing tires across the lot, over a concrete tire stop, through the bushes, down the hill between two light poles barely missing a line of new car, over two more concrete tire stops coming to a sideways stop in muddy grass only feet from the 6 lane highway in front of shelor dodge. they didn't know what happened. she blamed the detailer for resetting the pedals. i didn't hear shelors side of it, but i believe her telling of it with the exception that since she said the brakes didn't work, i believe she got her foot under the brake and firmly on the gas. (just my opinion). they said we'll have the truck fixed up for you in a couple of days, here, take this rental car. she wanted nothing to do with that truck and two days later (after a hospital visit-she was banged up pretty good) she picked out a white one slightly better trim which they gave her for the same deal. i asked if the new one had adjusable pedals to which she replied yes, but she has never touched the button."
"August 21, 2014  1:35AM",driver100," some people are very safety conscious.  i kind of just take my chances, i prefer as safe a car as possible, but safety isn't my number 1 priority. i also doubt i would trade in a car, because it got a low rating...in fact the 2008 cabriolet didn't get a great safety rating....and i didn't even think about it.  but, i do understand, up to a point, people don't want to drive in a poorly rated car if there are safer choices available. rb, don't you think most people put safety in their top 5 things to consider?"
"August 21, 2014  1:47AM",driver100," whewww...i thought this story was going in another direction! like i said, safety isn't my #1 priority item, but, i think i would try something other than a chrysler product at that point. what happens with the adjustable pedals to cause that to happen? i wonder how often that happens? how did your haircut turn out?"
"August 21, 2014  1:50AM",driver100," motorcycle hits car and motorcycle guy land on two feet (30 seconds - must be true, on fox-news)"
"August 21, 2014  2:04AM",imidazol97," not always the case. the bmw dealer would only give us $20k on a trade-in for our 2008 335. some silly story about that is all they would pay if buying a similar one at the bmw auction.(sounded suspicious to me) a car should be worth more to a dealer of that brand. i can hear the used car salesman now touting how it's their brand which is worth more, of course, and it was one owner traded back in to them for another of the same quality brand product the first owner chose the first time around. seldom would a used car shopper at a brand dealer think the store bought car from an auction. contrast the same vehicle sitting at a different brand lot. the used car shopper wonders if it was a trade for a model in their new line or was it bought from an auction. if it were traded for a model in the 2nd brand store, what didn't the owner like about the used car that made them chose the better model in the 2nd brand to trade for?"
"August 21, 2014  2:06AM",roadburner," maybe, but in the case of your acquaintance's wacko spouse, the issue was a car that <em>  passed or exceeded every government safety standard. </em> what it ""failed"" was one test promulgated by the iihs(in order to receive another fawning mention from the mainstream press). anybody that would quit riding in a car for that reason alone is a hand-wringing bedwetter who is as loopy as the day is long. feel free to give her a copy of this post."
"August 21, 2014  2:10AM",graphicguy," henry....i concur. i always get a carmax offer before attempting a trade.  i look in the classifieds to see what others asking.  if i can, i try to get black book and manheim numbers, too.  that way i have a really good idea what a dealer can buy it, and sell it for."
"August 21, 2014  3:39AM",cdnpinhead," &gt; very well put.  there are those whose posts i jump right over and then there are yours. besides which, i know a fair number of people who fit the description."
"August 21, 2014 10:04AM",oldfarmer50," now that's what i'm talking about. what year, late 80s early 90s?"
"August 21, 2014 10:26AM",oldfarmer50, hippy! some older people lose sensation in their feet and really can't tell what pedal they're pressing. i suspect that my wife does that.  since her stroke she has reduced feeling in her right foot and i think she drives with her foot touching the brake sometimes resulting in warped rotors for the second time in 26k miles.
"August 21, 2014 11:26AM",driver100," that's what i would have thought too, but, in my case it worked the opposite.  another factor is that if i wanted a used bmw the first place i would look is a bmw dealer.  but, i think the thinking was 1) if the audi dealer puts the car on the lot he doesn't have to give it a bmw extended warranty, and 2) lots of people want a german luxury car and it doesn't matter what dealership they see it at.  we have switched brands several times, and the dealer is happy to get our trade-ins, and all of them would have made good pre-owned car."
"August 21, 2014 11:31AM",driver100," you are probably right now that i think about it.  she drives an mb m class, probably because it is big and safe.  also, has all of these health and diet concerns.  guess there is a whole market out there that prays on peoples fears.......i wonder how i can get in on it?  have to work on that one."

"August 21, 2014  1:49PM",graphicguy," so, i recorded a ""wheeler dealer"" spinoff show where the mike guy travels around the world trading car until he comes up with some sort of super car. i was watching it last night and he was in sao paulo brazil (where i've spent a fair bit of time for work).  interesting city.  anyway, i've always marveled at the car they have there (first time i saw a ford ka).  he traded for a volkswagen combi van (kind of cool as it was in great condition).  but, he also traded for something he called a ""classic"".  it was a chevrolet opala (assuming a derivative of the gem, opal?). it looked to me to be a late '70s/early '80s chevrolet monte carlo.  not the pinnacle of gm's engineering, car building might.  it was also a 4 cyl, that when he started it up, reminded me an awful lot of the chevette''s 4 cyl sound.  again, not a gm bright spot. thought it humorous that he'd consider that a classic."
"August 21, 2014  2:05PM",qbrozen, didn't know they made another one of those. i'll have to find it. i enjoyed the first go round. i think it was only 6 or 8 episodes. he wound up with a 996 porsche in the finale in that one. i remember the travels included mexico and india. can't remember the others off the top of my head.
"August 21, 2014  2:13PM",stever," , the was sold here too, but only for fleets and rentals iirc. i think it was a post by where i first heard about them."
"August 21, 2014  2:23PM",Michaell," iirc, he also was in the uk and sweden, before ending up in dubai or somewhere else in the middle east. this season, he's buying and selling more car per episode. i'll have to find it - last night's episode got deleted from the dvr."
"August 21, 2014  3:38PM",Mr_Shiftright," given the carnage reflected in the annual statistics of auto fatalities and injuries, i don't understand how anyone could think that a particular car was ""safe"". there's really no such thing as a ""safe car""--that is marketing poof---at best one could say that ""some car are less dangerous than others"".  the dynamics of an auto accident are far too complex to plan against them. after all, you are surrounded by glass, not armor plate."
"August 21, 2014  4:13PM",isellhondas," one trick that some of the ""experts"" love to teach car buyer is to ""hide"" the trade from the deal and spring it after a number has been agreed on. any veteran can usually smell this coming. "" will you be trading in your buick"" "" ah...i think my neighbor will be buying it"" "" no, i think i'll just sell it myself"" yeah, right! then i'll look at the eight year old buick with 140,000 miles and know what's about to happen! but, i'll pretend otherwise. we work out a price on the new car, shake hands and i get ready to process the paperwork. "" ah, maybe i'll just trade in my buick"" that's when the fun starts! no, we don't want it and few wholesalers will either!  it's a 1000.00 car but the customer ""knows what they are selling for"" the a/c only needs a charge and the check engine light is ""probably a loose wire"" the grinder customer already wrung the last dollar out of the new car deal so i can't overallow on the trade.  it's hard for some people to come to grips with the fact that we don't want their trade! so, to save a deal, we stretch to 1300.00 on the trade and some wholesaler steps up and gives us 1100.00 for it....maybe!"
"August 21, 2014  4:18PM",qbrozen," yeah, i'm frankly disturbed that advice is still given. in my unprofessional opinion, it seems to me the trade is the harder part of the deal these days and a more likely place where it could all fall apart. so to go through all that trouble and waste all that time only to then find out your trade is worth thousands less than you thought.... ugh. hell, it gets me annoyed from the other side of the table, too. i've had some salespeople (probably green peas) try to talk price on their vehicle before even evaluating my trade. i have to tell them ""well, what i pay for yours will depend greatly on what you want to give me for mine, soo...."""
"August 21, 2014  4:52PM",bwia, agreed but your last comment is not entirely true. the accident death rate was extremely high in the last half of the 20th buick because of extremely rigid steel structures. thanks to mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz and others for their innovations with crumple zone technology designed to absorb the impact forces of a crash or collision.
"August 21, 2014  5:04PM",dino001," if you really see it coming and you really don't want the trade, you should either let the customer walk after he/she springs the car on you, or leave the room on the new car price to accommodate the unsurprising surprise.  you have not and end up bending over, and accepting their tactics, it only validated it (from point of view of maximizing the customer's outcome).  it's basically the reciprocal effect of those dealers who use unseemly tactics we all know about, yet keep getting business - people buying things from them also validate their ""business model""  (in their view, anyway).  in both cases, the only way to change peoples' behavior is to act on your disapproval, i.e. walk from the deal - whether dealer or customer."

(yeah, right, too busy to spend an hour that could potentially save them thousands of dollars!  but i digress...) the car dealer will (in most cases) inflate the value of your trade (to make  you feel better), and not discount his car the same as he would if you were buying outright. the best advice is not simplistic, as everyone here knows.  you have to do all of your homework.  know what the true selling price for the new car is (truecar is much better than edmunds at this time, edmunds needs to work on that).  and know what the real market value of your trade is (via qbrozens invalable assistance here in the forums and a trip to carmax).  have everything with you when you visit the dealer, including scratch paper and a calculator.  all smartphones have a calculator built in, in case you never looked. even then, some people are just going to be bad at this.  we all remember the recent article where some fairly high percentage of people surveyed said they would rather go to the dentist than shop for a new car.  now some of those people are just going to be afraid of confrontation, there are a lot of people who are very, very uncomfortable with the idea of telling a salesman that he is full of ____.  several of my friends and relatives routinely ask me to help them buy a car, because they know i'm good at it.  heck, i enjoy telling a salesman that he's full of ____.

"August 22, 2014  1:18PM",graphicguy," i've found there's a pretty big delta in what one dealership will offer over another.....sometimes thousands of dollars difference. like most, i know what i want for the trade, seen what the auctions are doing, carmax, looked to see what the market is in the newspaper (if there are a lot for sale and the prices they're asking). if i'm at a dealership, and they're lowballing me on the trade (meaning $1,000+ off the research i've done), i just move on to another dealership to make a deal.  i've gone as high as 4 dealerships, to get a trade number again, i'm looking for the delta between what they offer for my trade and the number i'm willing to pay for their new  car. i'll do a little pencil pushing on a trade. i think most of us here have pretty nice car.  we keep them in really good shape.  so, i become a little incredulous when a dealer, such as nyc' described, tells me i can buy these all day long at $xx,xxx, only to find a dealer that offers him thousands more. bottom line, don't insult me with your trade offer, and i won't insult you with my buy offer on your new car. that's a game we can all play....dealer low balls on the trade, i can go way under invoice on his new car. usually, i don't spend much time with a dealer who low balls my trade, though.  that means they want to grind me down with a lot of back and forth with the tower.  that's not how i roll....)"

"August 23, 2014 12:41AM",ab348," here's a buying experience for you when i was closing the deal on the buick, i questioned the addition of locking lug nuts on the invoice. i was told that this dealer adds them upon delivery to all car that have alloy wheels (not true i later discovered) and that since the car was a dealer demo they were ""used"" and therefore not returnable - something i frowned on but accepted. these were $140, which was the real reason for my discomfort, as you can buy these for $30 normally. i figured the 4 original chrome non-locking nuts would be in the car. sometime after delivery i searched for them and none were found. the locking nuts were big and ugly and i didn't want them on the car. i raised it with the shop when i happened to be in. a guy working there told me they just take an original nut off, put the locking nut on, and toss the originals in a box. armed with that info, i went back to my sales guy and asked for the 4 nuts. geez, you thought i was asking them to buy back the car. the ""box o'nuts"" had mysteriously disappeared. it would be impossible to find the originals. i suggested that perhaps the nuts off a car that had yet to receive the locks might be a source. oh no, couldn't do that. finally i get a phone message from the sales manager. because i was unhappy they were going to order me nuts from gm. sounded like they were doing me a favor. all i wanted was the 4 nuts that were installed at the factory and that i paid for when i bought the car. as it turned out i got a baggie with 5 nuts in it. ah well... why do dealers do such stupid things?"

"August 23, 2014  4:43AM",nyccarguy," my dad who i consider pretty smart actually took out a 72 month loan on his current 2011 tahoe.  the reason?  same as .  free money.  for 6 years.  he had a 2010 tahoe that he was quote happy with.  he was financing the 2010 at 2.9% for 60 months.  in 2012, he traded the 2010 tahoe for his current 2011 tahoe."
"August 23, 2014 10:07AM",oldfarmer50," makes no sense to pay off a 0% loan early.  i made over $4k on the $26,000 that remained in investments over the 5 years of my loan.  any time someone offers free money....take it."
"August 23, 2014 10:37AM",explorerx4," a lot of times there is cash back or a low finance rate. it depends on how they compare. we have 3 vehicles 10 years or older that we bought new, so i would consider a 6 year loan, if the terms worked out. my fusion has a 5 year loan, but i am working toward paying it off in 4 years."
"August 23, 2014 11:41AM",nyccarguy," i'd have no problem taking a 72 month loan for the right terms (0%, 0.9%, or 1.9%) on the right car (something that i know i'd never be under water on)."
"August 23, 2014 11:46AM",nyccarguy," i found this somewhat interesting.  not ""breaking news,"" but just about the used car market in general."
"August 23, 2014  1:00PM",driver100," thanks nyc...i found that article really interesting.  i didn't realize used car market was about 3x the new car market.  also, the profit margins could be better than new car.  good article."
"August 23, 2014  2:42PM",nyccarguy," i copied the following from stamford's website just in case you wanted me to elaborate more **what is the grand list? the total assessed value of all taxable property, as determined by the assessor on october 1, is called the grand list. the grand list must be completed by the assessor and filed with the town clerk by january 31 (if necessary, the assessor may request an extension to the end of february to complete his duties). how am i assessed exactly? mill rate based on the grand list and the determination of the city operating budget, a tax rat (the mill rate) is set by the board of finance. the property tax rate in mills or thousandths of a dollar. for example, a tax rate of 30 mills is equivalent to $30.00 per $1,000 of assessed value. more on mill rate grand levy the amount of revenue which must be raixsed by the property tax is called the grand levy. when the grand levy is determined, tax bills are prepared. property tax rate the property tax rate is determined by dividing the grand levy by the grand list. this rate is then applied to each taxpayer's taxable property. tax bills taxes on real property are due and payable in two installments; july 1 and january 1. taxes on personal property, to include taxes on motor vehicles, are due and payable in one installment; july 1. ** for all motor vehicles garaged or registered in the city of stamford $26.50 per $1000"
"August 23, 2014  3:32PM",ab348," the tax on personal property is something that goes way, way back in some areas. it is a royal pain to prepare the assessment roll and is fraught with inaccuracy. it is designed to measure the ""ability to pay"" so theoretically it is a measure of how wealthy you are, though in reality it is anything but. i used to work in assessment up here and we only did real property assessment as we have no annual tax on pp. i can only imagine the pain it must be to have to develop the pp assessment roll. even with computerized systems it would be subject to all sorts of disputes and appeals. tax theory is a strange specialty and i think it is fair to say there is no one right way to do it. here we do an annual tax on real property and that's it, though we have hefty sales and income taxes. to toss personal property into the mix would add a measure on unfairness as only certain things qualify. and of course if you have investments they are missed also. i'm surprised so many places still maintain a pp tax as the administration must be huge."

"August 23, 2014 11:58PM",driver100," just a quick up date.  s-i-l's son, our grandson, who was driving the volvo that broke down and needs a new engine, was going to consider a nissan nissan.  (i did get miles and age wrong, i got new information, car is 15 years old and has 220k miles).  the grandson has an excellent job, just graduated, and i thought it would be a good time to start him in a new or slightly used 2 or 3 year old car, so he would have a reliable car for getting to work, or to go on an assignment which might happen. parents decided he should get the engine repaired instead.  they think it will cost $2000 but i have a feeling it will be more than that.  remember, they spent about $4000 last year on transmission repairs. sounds like a slippery slope to me.....probably with a snowman effect, this is just the start. car looks like this and is probably worth about $2000 as a trade.  one good thing, people love them and say they are built like a tank and they hold up really well.  of, you should look for one of these...."
"August 24, 2014  1:39AM",oldfarmer50, i can't imagine paying tax on you furniture.  how would they even know how to value it.  wouldn't people be tempted to claim they were using orange crates?

"August 24, 2014  1:49AM",oldfarmer50, if it needs a new engine it is only worth scrap value.  the kid could get the same $2000 off sticker on a year end deal. having replaced several engines myself i'm pretty sure it will cost $2000 just for the replacement motor. if it's any newer than a 99 it's got a lot of ford influence and who would sink money into a ford with 220k miles. there's a point of diminishing returns with any car and that one has reached it. i would shy away from a volvo just because of what you   people love them and think they are well built.  drives the price way up.  i prefer used car that people scoff at. usually they are overly negative and it drops the price.
"August 24, 2014  2:01AM",oldfarmer50, here's a question for those who lease. how much more expensive is it to purchase a car at the end of a lease rather than having bought it outright?  by how much does the lease + buyout price + associated fees exceed the original price? if you were going into a lease with the idea of buying it later would it make a difference if you choose a car that maintained a high residual like honda or one that depreciated quickly like a hyundai?  or would it even out between lease and buyout costs?

"August 24, 2014  3:00AM",mako1a," these days walking out the door is not hard to do, but not that many years ago i heard horror stories of unscrupulous dealers who would (ahem) misplace your keys keeping you there longer. it actually happened to a friend of mine and his wife. she (the italian) said again give me back my keys...we're leaving! when the sales guy feigned the old can't find them she got on the phone. another salesman said ""she's calling the cops, give her the keys"" boy were they wrong. she was calling her brother. one bad dude who would have torn a few salesmen apart to help his sister. i even heard of keys being tossed onto the roof just to stall a customer. not sure if that one is true, but then again, who knows."

"August 24, 2014  1:14PM",driver100," there's a point of diminishing returns with any car and that one has reached it. some really good information there of, from the master of the older pre-owned vehicle.  i like what you said about the cost of the engine vs getting $2000 off sticker on a new car.  especially at this time of year, but, when the grandson has a major breakdown the car will be worth nothing, and he will have to scdodgeble and pay more just to get a car right away so he can get to his new job. i am glad you confirmed my basic thoughts, and added to them with some good basic factual information."
"August 24, 2014  1:26PM",driver100," i will give you a basic answer as i have leased car in the past, and i think it is a good way to obtain a new car in certain situations. the dealer usually bases the lease on what they would sell the car for, without much of a discount.  they calculate what the car will be worth at the end of the lease, and that is the price you will pay if you buy the car back. if the car depreciates slower, your monthly payments will be less, but, your buy back will be higher, because the car will be worth more than a quickly depreciating car...you are going to pay one way or the other.  but, that could work say if you lease a cadillac, higher lease payments which you can claim on taxes, then buy the car back for a low price and use it as a 2nd car. btw...those lease payments are usually calculated at a higher rate of interest than say your friendly bank, after all it is financed by the car company...and that's easy money for them.  you are dealing with people who only care what their monthly payment is going to be. in short, the payout cost will even out if the car depreciates faster.  probably the best thing is to lease a car with low depreciation...say a bmw, and then not buy it back at the end of the lease, and the next owner will pay more for the unused portion of the car's life. in the case of my grandson, he has a good job, but not much saved up.  his future prospects seem good.  i think he should lease a new car now...no problem for 3 years at least, and then buy the car back at the end of the lease if he likes the car, and he will be earning more, he can finance it easily.  he doesn't plan on driving a lot (kind of a green guy), and he will have a nice car he can drive for 10 years.  better than throwing another $2000 at a car that is really worth nothing."
"August 24, 2014  1:42PM",driver100," mike, my cell phone is a clamshell type that i use about twice a month.  i wouldn't know what to do with an app.  but, i can go online and build an mb, but they still show 2014s.  maybe you should try another site, just in case.  the dealer did have the list of options and prices so i know what i am getting. oh yes, i saw a white e350 on the road and it was white and i really like the white with the black (sunroof) top.  i went to the dealer and they had a diamond silver metalic and a white e in the showroom, almost side by side.  i liked the white slightly more, so changed my order.  he said, good thing you came in today, it was the last day you could have changed your mind. white is the number one color these days, about 22%.  black is a close 2nd, followed by silver and gray.  a very good edmunds article about color said people who choose white are saying ""less is more"" kind of thing.  silver is probably related to our technology age."
"August 24, 2014  1:46PM",imidazol97," one good thing, people love them and say they are built like a tank and they hold up really well.  of, you should look for one of these.... of course, if volvos are reliable, hold up really well, and are built like a tank, they don't need a new engine and transmission at 200k. just sayin'..."
"August 24, 2014  2:04PM",Michaell," here in colorado, we also pay a 'personal property tax' on our vehicles with our annual registration. the formula works like this. start with 85% of the 'base' msrp - before any options. then, multiply that amount by 2.1% for the first year taxes. each year the tax rate decreases (1.5%, 1.2%, .9%) until year 5 where it bottoms out at .45%, or $10, whichever is greater. at 10 years the tax is reduced to $3. but, this can be claimed on your tax return."

"August 24, 2014  4:28PM",robr2," here in ma, we pay an annual excise tax on car that works out to be $25 per $1000 of the value based on the following scale in the designated year of manufacture- 90% of msrp in the second year - 60% of msrp in the third year - 40% of msrp in the fourth year - 25% of msrp in the fifth and succeeding years -10% of msrp. it's also pro-rated for the first year.  so if i were to buy a $35k 2014 today, i would pay 35,000 / 1000 x 25 x .9 / 12 x 4 = $262.50.  year 2 would be $525. registration for standard plates is $60 every other year. one can look at taxes many different ways.  for instance, i have a friend who touts the great income and sales tax free nature of new hampshire yet complains about his property tax which is about 4 times what i pay and his house is worth 25% less.  to top it off, he felt that the schools were pretty poor in his town so he spent another $20k a year putting his kids through private schools.  nh also has a 9% meal tax which is pretty high imho. the california tax rate of 13.5% is on those who make over $1 million.  it ranges from a low of 1% to the 13.5%.  but the property tax rate in ca is pretty low due to proposition 13. as for florida, yes it is great for residents as they sales tax on everything but food.  but here in ma, we don't have a sales tax on clothing whereas florida does.  florida of course relies heavily on tourist spending with a lodging tax of up to 13% which imho, they should take advantage of."
"August 24, 2014  5:14PM",abacomike," i think white is a much nicer color than that blue diamond silver color you originally ordered.  white and silver are the most popular colors down here.  i am surprised that white is so popular up in canada where you guys get quite a bit of snow.  the white car blend in with the snow on the ground making the car less visible i would think.  down here, white is more practical since it reflects the sun the most of any other color. i stopped into my mercedes-benz benz dealer today for car wash (the car was filthy from sitting outside for 3 or more weeks.  he pulled up the ordering guide for the car i ordered and i was correct - edmunds is incorrect!  the lane tracking package (blind spot monitors and lane tracking) is a standard feature of the e400 in the u.s. as is the premium package, fold down rear seat, amg 18"" wheels with all season tires, and power folding outside rear mirrors. i am finally going to have all season tires on a car for better wear and longevity.  i will also be able to rotate the tires for the first time since all the wheels and tires are the same size. i am going to try to build the e400 on the main site for edmunds to see what takes place."
"August 24, 2014  5:34PM",graphicguy," mike....thought of you yesterday.  i was on my way to ikea to buy some chairs my wife wanted.  there's a mercedes-benz benz dealer right along the way and about two blocks away.  for grins, i decided to see if they had any '15 c300s.  they had two, one white and one silver.  interior is pretty.  might be teh colors, but i'm ambivalent about the exterior.  hard to tell them apart from the current e class, which for some reason looked nicer, but the only e class i saw was in 'black, which i like. sticker was $50k and change on both.  but, both were 4 cyl, so hard for me to get excited about them.  i think they had nav but no leather.  kind of a tough pill to swallow for $50k and not toltally loaded up.  maybe the c400 is the way to go, if it comes all loaded up out of the box (c400)."
"August 24, 2014  5:41PM",houdini1, that seems pretty rich for a 4 cyl c class with no leather. pass.
"August 24, 2014  6:08PM",ab348," the discussion on colors is interesting, as i was out cruising the dealership lots this morning (they are all closed here on sundays) looking at what might tickle my fancy if i decide to change car once the lease on the buick is up in a couple of months. i was struck by how dark and dreary so many of the colors on the car inventory were. i don't know if this is typical everywhere or a local thing, but the dealers here seem loath to order a car for stock with anything other than a black interior. that is bad for me as i hate black interiors. i saw a buick at one of the buick dealers in ""champagne silver"", which isn't silver at all but a pale gold or tan metallic, and figured that would have some color inside. nope, black. all the buick i saw were black leather. i don't think i want one of those anyway, but black leather kills it for me. the other ones in inventory were a black metallic paint outside which i don't like either, and ""graphite blue"" which i thought was black until i got close - it is very, very dark and i didn't like it. over on the cadillac side, all models in inventory were also black leather. at first i thought they were all painted black. a few were - some solid black, some that same metallic black as the buick - but others just looked black. one was painted ""majestic plum"" which is a color i had seen listed on caddy's web page but had never recognized in the flesh. well, it turns out it is so dark that it reads as black unless it's in direct sunlight. really a shame, it is kind of lifeless. they had one in phantom gray, which is a dark gray but not a shade i like (some grays look good to me but not this one). the ats models were parked alongside the cts models and they really look small by comparison. i like the cts better but it is much more expensive too. i rolled through the bmw lot fairly quickly as i'm not that interested in them but i was struck by how all the car in inventory seemed to be painted either black or white. there may have been a silver one but i'm not sure of that. aside from one of the 2-seaters (z4?) which was red, no color at all there. odd. over to the mercedes-benz benz dealer. lots of black car here too but naturally a lot of iridium silver also. i saw an e class sedan in cavansite blue, which was also very dark but not as dark a blue as the buick. it looked good to me but i don't know if i'd want a dark blue car. it was one of the few without a black interior - i'd say almost all of the m-bs here had black inside except for that blue mercedes-benz benz, which was crystal gray with black trim inside, and another new e-350 sedan in a brown metallic that looked ok with a nice beige interior. i can't find that brown on the website so i don't know what's up with that. i was surprised to see they have 2 leftover 2013s parked out front, one of them a 550, with writing on the windshields about how much they are discounted. the 2013 e550 sedan claimed a sticker of $82k and was marked down to $69k. but they are the old style car and i think they might have a hard time moving them. they had a c-series coupe parked next to an e-350 coupe out front also. i like the look of the e coupe much better than the c but was surprised that it didn't look all that much bigger than the c. inside it seemed much smaller than the e sedan so i would have to see if i fit ok. this one was white and looked great outside, but it had a black interior which i think would have looked better in some other shade. i really miss the days of colorful car inside and out."
"August 24, 2014  6:58PM",driver100," i read some reviews from owners of 1990 91 volvos, and they all said they were pretty good, one had 300k miles with no major problem.  but, it could be a case of people who keep them and have good luck with them praise them...those that have one's that don't do so well, just trade them and forget them. <strong>  one rule i was thinking of after oldfarmers post is  don't spend more on a car repair than the car is worth! </strong>"
"August 24, 2014  7:06PM",abacomike," yes, i saw a c400 this morning at the dealership.  just my opinion, but when you are spending $54,000 for a c class (which is what a c400 probably goes for), i think you are much better off with an e350.  for around $56,500 msrp, you can get a nicely loaded e350.  i personally do not feel leather is needed with a mercedes-benz benz because the mbtex (rich vinyl) is so much like the real leather, you really can't tell the difference.  the only reason i get leather is because i need the ventilated seat down her, and the only was to get the ventilated seat with perforated holes to allow the air to flow through the seat and back of the seat is to order the leather."
"August 24, 2014  7:10PM",driver100," actually, you are right about white not being so popular in canada.  when i looked up the information white was #1 in the usa and all of a sudden around the world.  all those isis toyota trucks are always white. in canada, the number one choice is silver, and white is way down the list, probably for the reason you gave...looks like snow. country-wide, 22.3 per cent of canadians chose silver/grey for their new car, black followed well behind at 14.1 per cent, blue came in at 13.6 per cent and red followed at 11.6 per cent. surprisingly, the colour white -- a popular choice in warmer climes -- came in at just fifth place at 6.9 per cent. the study suggests canada's messy winter driving conditions may have led drivers here to avoid the hard-to-keep-clean colour choice. i can't imagine changing tires as often as you did on your high performance car.  i'll be glad to have all-season tires and not run flats.  as we get older we tend to like our creature comforts, and it is nice if you can make life easier for yourself."
"August 24, 2014  7:21PM",driver100," i agree with your opinions on color.  i prefer a lighter interior, hard to keep clean but it just seems to be brighter and livelier.  black is popular because it needs less maintenance, you just don't have to worry about it as much. about exterior colours.  it seems the less expensive car have some of the best colors...i have seen some nice blues on a cruz and on hyundai.  some of those car also have nice light beige and gray interiors....at one time inexpensive car only had black or gray. one reason i like white is i don't really get tired of it, and i think it will always be in fashion, even on appliances.  harvest gold and olive green and bronze may fade, but white, never really goes out of style.....just to me anyway."
"August 24, 2014  7:28PM",roadburner," i'm 57 and i run summer rubber on the ms3 and the bmw, swapping them with suitable winter rubber in late november and going back to serious tires in early april. it takes me all of 30 minutes per car- thats why they make aluminum racing jacks and 18v cordless impact wrenches. cake."
"August 24, 2014  7:28PM",abacomike," i would think the all-season tires should be a bit softer in ride since they are not as low profile as the summer tires.  i've never had all-seasons down here because i always order the ""sport"" version of the car which comes standard, usually, with summer tires.  the e400 comes standard with 18"" amg wheels and all-season tires.  there is a ""no-cost"" option to order the summer tires, if you want them. i tried to change something on the car about 10 days ago but was unable to.  i had called from california to ask if i could add wheel locks and comfort box, but he said the car was ""locked"" which means it was not changeable.  so i am going to assume that my car will be built a little sooner than yours since you could change something yesterday/today. the way it is ordered now, it comes standard with *3.0 liter v6 w/329 hp and 354 ft lbs of torque *premium 1 package (nav, harman/karmin logic 7 surround, rear power sunshade, 6 disc cd/dvd player, power retractable outside mirrors, rear folding seat) *leather, heated and ventilated seat, lane tracking and blind spot monitors *18"" amg wheels w/all-season tires *keyless go *burl walnut trim options *parking assist package *lighting package *keyless go package which ads hands free access and power trunk *wood/leather steering wheel *rear spoiler *active multi-contour ddriver's seat with massage msrp is $69,135 they said they can add the wheel locks and comfort box at the dealership when the car comes in.  scheduled date for manufacture is september 7, 2014, and should arrive at the dealership 5 weeks later."
"August 24, 2014  7:41PM",abacomike," most people do not like black interiors because they tend to be colder in the winter and hotter in the summer.  but i found that black is best down here in a hot/humid climate.  when i had the light gray or beige interiors, the got grimy and filthy so quickly down here.  black doesn't show the dirt and grime, but it does scuff easier, but the scuff marks are easier to take out than the grime on the leather seat.  besides, i always get the ventilated seat which cool off very quickly in the heat. but i can definitely understand your aversion to black interiors.  now, if mercedes-benz benz offered a medium or dark gray leather interior, i would prefer that, however they do not.  they offer an extra cost optional maroon leather which would look great in my light gray car, but when it comes times to sell the car, most people prefer the basic colors."
"August 24, 2014  8:04PM",bwia," hey *driver, it seems as though your french canadian spelling is driving you nuts. to be consistent with <b>  colour </b> tire should be <b>  tyre. </b>"
"August 24, 2014  8:22PM",Michaell," i grew up in ca and my folks still live there. i remember all the hoopla over prop 13 when it was on the ballot. dad was a firefighter and he was real concerned that the lack of property tax would affect public services. it did, but he survived it. now, they've been in their house since 1968, so their property tax is protected under prop 13. if they were to sell their house and buy a new one, they would have to pay the full rate on property tax."

"August 24, 2014  9:43PM",oldfarmer50," so the bottom line is it costs you more if you lease then buy vs. just buying in the beginning. would you care to venture a guess as to how much more?  5%, 10%....more?"
"August 24, 2014  9:48PM",oldfarmer50, or anywhere else where they use road salt. in salt free areas white weathers better than many other colors.  black and red burn the clear cost off in sunny places like florida.  i've seen 30 year old white car with good looking original paint in the south.  i've seen 10 year old white car in the north showing every spot of rust like neon.
"August 24, 2014 10:15PM",oldfarmer50," i agree 100% about the black interiors.  why are car makers so in love with black?  especially leather.  wouldn't want to jump onto that after parking the car in sun. the ford website now offers my ford with lighter seat inserts called ""cedodgeic"". looks like grey on the ford page but off white at other sources.  i think i like it.  if i step up to premium trim there's another terra cotta color seat which i'm undecided on but since that trim adds $5k to the price and doesn't allow the dark red exterior i want it's moot."

""colour"" is actually british and in english canada we usually use british spelling.i believe french is couleur.  in england i believe they still use ""tyre"", but in canada we use the u.s. word ""tire"" possibly because when goodyear and firestone etc came here they just wanted to use the same sign. considering all the rules i am doing not too badly, but it is nice to know someone reads my posts that carefully."
"August 25, 2014 12:29AM",driver100," there's an interesting question.  i would guess, and this is really a guess, you will pay $1000 and more likely $2000 to lease a $30k car.  don't forget, you are paying a premium to drive a new car for a much lower payment.  also, in some cases i would prefer to drive the car for 3 years, and then decide whether i really want to own it.  i would do that if i was buying a high maintenance car, rover, volkswagen volkswagen, tesla, for example.  also, if i didn't know what my situation was going to be in 3 years. another thing, costs can be hidden better in a lease, you can get 0% payments like you did if you buy.  they don't do that with leases.  most people leasing just care about their monthly payment, some don't even think about the residual cost, which is very important to connsider too, it can really vary."
"August 25, 2014 12:41AM",qbrozen," actually, leasing first can be cheaper. it is rare, but it happens. sometimes a manufacturer puts big trunk money and ultra-low (nearly 0%) rate on a lease while not offering anything on a purchase. i've had it happen twice. once was a mazdaudi lease for my bil. he wanted to buy but i showed him it actually came out a whopping $200 less over 5 years if he took advantage of their special 24-mo lease. a big deal? no. but even more valuable than that $200 was him being able to make the decision in 24 months to keep or bail. he wound up choosing to bail, so it worked out. another example was an honda i leased back in '06. the discount off the sticker was the same whether you leased or financed, but, at that moment, honda wasn't offering any special finance rates that could come anywhere close to the lease money factor, which worked out to something south of 1%. couple that with the $0 acquisition fee and $0 security deposit, and it was a pretty easy choice."

"August 26, 2014  6:29PM",robr2," first market basket is a family owned grocery store in massachusetts, nh and southern maine.  their prices are about 10-20% below the competition.  they don't do double coupons.  they didn't have a website until recently.  they don't have loyalty cards.  they don't have any debt and they have been expanding/remodeling stores recently.  they did about $4.5 billion in sales last year and have a net margin of between 8% and 10%.  a typical grocery chain is somewhere in the 1% to 2% range.  the stores are mobbed and the deli line is at least 20 minutes - no matter the store or time of day. two cousins, arthur t and arthur s demoulas, each head a side of the family. t has been the ceo for a number of years and is beloved by the vast majority of the employees.  pay is good (cashiers can make $40k/year), health insurance is 100% paid, pension plan (yep a pension plan) is fully company funded, everyone (even part time clerks) get quarterly bonuses and the executives under t all started as baggers or stockers.  some employees have been there 50 years and many retire with 7 figure pensions. t's side of the family holds 49.5% of the stock.  s's side holds 50.5%.  but the widow and daughter of s's late brother threw their support behind t because the widow was mad at s for something he said about the daughter's acting career years ago.  keep in mind, this is a greek family in 2013, the angered widow switched loyalties to s to give him control of a majority.  with that majority, he could get the board to distribute a special dividend to the family.  t was opposed because retained earnings is what he uses to grow the company.  shortly thereafter, the board of directors approved a $350 million dollar dividend to be divided among 9 the 9 shareholders on top of the $100 million in dividends it usually pays annually.  in retaliation, t instituted an extra 4% discount at the chain for all of 2014 which pissed off s. in june of 2014, the board fired t and two other executives.  when that happened, the 25,000 market basket employees started to walk off the job and picket - first at headquarters and the distribution centers and then at the stores.  the stores were still open and selling whatever they had but most employees spent their time putting up protest signs in the store, asking for signatures on petitions and picketing out front - some while on the clock. in the past few weeks many employees have given up pay, the part time staff has been let go, the full time staff has been notified multiple times to report back to work and if they don't mb will consider them to have abandoned their jobs (precluding them from collecting unemployment), competing chains can't keep up with the demand with some bringing staff in from western ma, ct, me, ny, some vendors have started to publicly call out the new management and s is looking to sell the company - which imho was his ultimate goal.  t has made a bid of $1.5 billion for the s family 50.5% and supposedly it's been accepted but that was saturday and not a peep from anyone. why do these two hate each so much?  when their fathers (t=mike and s=george) bought the single family grocery store from their parents, they vowed to take care of each other's families should anything happen.  well george died in 1971 and over the years, mike managed to siphon off almost 90% of george's share.  s sued his uncle in 1990 and the judge sided with him giving his side of the family 50.5% and a $205 million payback from uncle mike.  at the time, t was active in the business and was found to have known what was going on.  further, t owns much of the real estate that mb pays rent to, he is accused of selling property to the company at inflated prices and two of his brothers-in-law head up the development company mb uses to build the stores. what it comes down to is t and s hate each other and have for years t is the only family member involved in the business and he has a bit of a ""see what i do"" attitude s and rest of his family want out as they can't sell their stock to anyone else and they see t spending ""their"" money on new stores and employee pay and benefits the employees are afraid if s sells the company to anyone but t, their pay and benefits will be reduced the customers are stuck in the middle and although many claim to be boycotting, i think they would come right back to mb even if t wasn't in charge as long as the prices stayed close to where they are now. sorry for the long story.  i love business ddodgeas."

"August 28, 2014  2:17PM",tyguy," no&gt;  ha,ha.  no cult, but you do have to be quick.  the manufacturer just moved it to a pro-only product and released a more consumer version with less durability.  i immediately ordered a couple of tubes for my outback and family's car.  the stuff is called optimum opti-coat 2.0.  one 20cc tube will cover two vehicles.  the new stuff is called gloss-coat, but i can't recommend it since it's brand new, untested, and less durable than the product it replaces.  if you can't find opti-guard 2.0 since supplies will be dwindling fast, then the next best product will probably be carpro cquartz. one thing about these new coatings they lock in both imperfect paint and perfect paint.  before you apply the coating, make sure you're happy with the paint condition.  clay bar, iron x, and blemish removal should be completed first.  the last thing you'll do before applying the coating is to spray and wipe down the entire vehicle with a 15% isopropyl alcohol solution to remove all waxes, oils, and fillers so the coating can bond with the paint."
"August 28, 2014  2:32PM",bwia," &gt; speaking of zaino, i am looking for a fuel stabilizer. my suv has arrived from japan and since it will be garaged in st. lucia for long periods of time (six months or more) i want to make sure the engine does not seize up. don't know if being in the tropics makes a difference but sometimes there are periods of high humidity which may have a negative impact on a parked vehicle. also, would you guys recommend disconnecting the battery while the vehicle is in deep sleep? i can probably get someone to drive the vehicle every two weeks or so but i don't want that to be a carte blanche for driving my suv into the ground. wish me luck."
"August 28, 2014  2:43PM",qbrozen, 6 mos really isn't an issue as far as the engine or even gas is concerned. i've had car sit for much longer with no ill effects. is there an outlet you can use? a battery tender would be ideal.
"August 28, 2014  2:43PM",ray80, perhaps one of the sta-bil  products would work.   battery disconnect would be good also
"August 28, 2014  2:53PM",ab348, i use sta-bil every winter in my cutlass and it seems good. no issues.

"August 28, 2014  8:52PM",mako1a," dings, dents and parking in the south forty depend on where you live and your neighbors. when i lived in virginia beach, dings were common. especially if you parked next to a van full of kids. here in a small town after 10 years i have zero dings/dents to show for parking close in. parents actually teach their children to respect property of others and stop them from pushing the door open fully with full force. thank you wytheville parents."

"August 28, 2014 11:18PM",driver100," 2&gt; i gave up doing that.  i got more dings when i tried to be extra careful.  i try to park in a wide spot, maybe with no other car on one side.  i try not to park to someone with wide doors or with lots of dents.  but, if you are too careful you just make matters worse. the only warning i would have is if you leave your car outside and your area is prone to vandalism.  i don't know what goes on in people's minds, but that is worth considering. repairs, tires, etc. could cost up to double, but i think it is worth it.  i don't like driving a good european car without a warranty, so i would always want a warranty.  you can buy them for at least 5 years more, maybe 7.  you still have to pay for wiper blades, alignments, brakes, and although they will be more i think it is worth it. i don't think so, i think you adjust. i think the things to consider the most are; *will buying this car crimp my lifestyle?  will i have to give up something i enjoy to buy it?  if it will, don't do it, you will resent the car. *do i find it hard to spend money?  if the answer is yes, then don't do it.  you will always say a chev chevrolet could have got me from a to b, i'd rather watch the money grow in the bank. *if you appreciate a fine car, great handling, beautiful upholestry, driving dynamics, top engineering, and you can manage it financially then i would say go for it.  driving will take on a whole new enjoyable dimension.  you will appreciate fine engineering and you will be glad you bought a top engineered car. i had a 1995 and a 2000 jeep and i loved them.  could never see myself driving a luxury car.  my wife insisted i try a bmw when i was looking for a new suv in 2004.  when i drove a bmw x3 for the first time i truly didn't want to get out of the car, i didn't know how much fun driving a car could be. if it doesn't cause financial hardship, and you appreciate a fine car, then you really have to give it a try.  i have driven quite a few rental car since owning bmw, mbs and audis, but i love getting back into my own car....there is a huge difference.....to me it is worth it, as of said, you can't take it with you.  my children won't appreciate any money that we leave, so i will enjoy life the best i can."

"August 28, 2014 11:57PM",ab348, heat pumps are making a big dent in the sales of replacement furnaces and air conditioning systems up here. the only time they need supplemental heating is on the coldest days and apparently that happens infrequently enough that you can get by with an electric coil if your house is well-insulated. we are largely dependent on heating oil up here though so the relative cost of energy probably plays a role in whether one makes sense elsewhere.
"August 28, 2014 11:58PM",abacomike,
"August 29, 2014 12:02AM",ab348," thanks for the insights on luxo-car ownership folks. still pondering my options. i was out for a drive tonight in the '68 cutlass and it was as if the gods knew what i was dwelling on. first while sitting at an intersection i saw a sl roadster coming towards me, never saw one of those around here before. impressive. then later on coming down the street towards me was a white e coupe that i had not seen before. wow, what a neat looking machine. looked good in white."
"August 29, 2014 12:17AM",roadburner, we have a heat pump and our electric bill is consistently less than $200/month.
"August 29, 2014  1:06AM",explorerx4," . you could try a 2 year lease on a nice car. it's long enough to figure out if you like it, but it is not a long term commitment, like buying it. leased vehicles have allowances for thing like door dings. try to avoid going over the mileage limit."

"August 29, 2014  1:48AM",imidazol97," our lennox is at 22 years and counting. it was a fairly efficient single speed model when purchased.  i'm considering a hybrid unit for replacement because there's a push to put a natural gas line on our road. otherwise, i'll just get another fairly efficient model, likely a lennox. for many people, i'd consider the heat pumps that use a ground loop with a liquid circulated through the earth at it's typical 55 deg f temperature. that makes the heat pump really efficient in operation for heat as well as for cooling because it's moving heat in or out of 55 deg ""water."" better than trying to move heat into or out of the ambient air temperature."

"August 29, 2014 11:18AM",driver100," a guy was on the radio yesterday talking about the best way to negotiate buying a new car.  one idea he had, which i never heard of or thought of was to tell the salesman you are cross shopping.  if you are looking at a toyota, tell the salesman you will be comparing the car to a focus or chevrolet.  that eases the pressure, gives you a chance to walk away and think, makes him come up with a competitive price. sounds not bad....too bad there is all this game playing going on just to buy a car........."
"August 29, 2014 11:25AM",abacomike,
"August 29, 2014 11:57AM",karhill1," bingo!  that succicntly sums up how to purchase a vehicle.  be completely up front, no games  well maybe one, often a good strategy to set a price a bit lower than the price for which you will buy.  gives them a little win if you appear to come up a bit from the stated price. i can testify, based on many years of buying, works every time.  sometimes have to contact more than one dealer but, as you note, there is always another dealer."
"August 29, 2014  2:39PM",jayrider," the only problem with that approach is that people aren't realistic on the discount or the trade. the hard part is finding that range of $1000 where both parties can be happy. the trade is the tough part. if you have a carmax nearby, that would at least give you a number that will actually buy your car. the books and pricing sites vary. oh well, i'm happy with both my car so that issue is moot --- but still interesting."
"August 29, 2014  2:46PM",driver100," that $1000 spread is the hardest part...between getting the price down on the new car, and the value of the trade in. the guy on the radio also said (the mention of carmax reminded me), take your trade-in to a dealer who sells car similar to yours.  find out what they would give you for it....just so you have an alternative and so you have some idea of what it is worth, maybe confirm your online price. i like that, but then there is that sales tax thing...too bad you can't sell your car to one dealer but get a reduction on the taxes paid on the new car."
"August 29, 2014  3:03PM",bwia," thanks tyguy, fordx4, oldfarmer50, ab348, qbrozen, ray80 and others for your many very helpful suggestions on how to prepare a vehicle for long-term storage. i have another question though, the petrol used in the caribbean is 100% gasoline from venezuela. would using sta-bil make a difference if the gasoline is not an ethanol mix?"
"August 29, 2014  3:07PM",abacomike,
"August 29, 2014  3:15PM",bwia," what a happy problem to have if you can afford a vehicle in that price range. like the others said, if you feel all the range of anxieties you mentioned, perhaps you should think of leasing. personally, i would never lease an automobile for personal use. arguably, it is the most expensive way to finance an automobile. regardless of the financing option you choose i think you should go for it and live your best life now--not later when you are too old to drive."
"August 29, 2014  3:16PM",robr2, sta-bil makes both a storage additive as well as one to deal with ethanol in small engines.  regular sta-bil should work for you.
"August 29, 2014  4:08PM",graphicguy," imid...were you in west chester, oh?  if so, let me know if you're around the area again.  i'll meet up for lunch. we're still house hunting.  not sure we're going to stay in the same general vicinity. i used to have bengals season tickets.  the guy i sold mine to asked if i wanted to see the last pre-season game last night.  we went.  he insisted on driving.  he had just bought a mercedes-benz benz m wagon.  never been in one.  that's a pretty nice way to travel.  i liked it. not sure it offered anything more than my previous chevrolet tahoe, but still nice."
"August 29, 2014  4:20PM",Mr_Shiftright, a laguna seca version of the ford would hold my interest!
"August 29, 2014  4:52PM",roadburner," my friend at <em>  r&amp;t </em> has driven both the ""plain"" boss as well as the laguna seca and in his opinion the primary advantage of the laguna seca is its future status as a collectable. yes, it's faster on the track, but not significantly so."
"August 29, 2014  4:53PM",driver100, didn't even know there was such an animal.  what does it do that a regular normal ford won't do? btw...this one was on ebay for about $52k
"August 29, 2014  5:03PM",laurasdada," ab348  another take on the issue 1.i always look for the parking spot in lots that is closest to where i need to go. will i now be that guy all by himself at the far end of the lot? by parking farther away, you will walk more, increasing heart-rate, metabolism and hence, lose weight.  you will then have to revamp your wardrobe to fit your new streamlined body.  women will begin to pay more attention to you, you will date more.  you will end up marrying a much younger woman.  she, of course, will divorce you, taking half of everything and, most likely, your lovely mercedes-benz benz.  you will become depressed, stop walking, eat more and gain weight.  so, ultimately, what's the point? risk and reward, my friend."
"August 29, 2014  5:06PM",qbrozen," what i find funny is that you could take a gt and turn it into a boss 302 for very little money or a laguna seca for a bit more. far less than it would cost you to buy a factory version. yet, if you did it to a gt, it would be worth less than a gt because you've modified it. collectors are a strange bunch."
"August 29, 2014  5:10PM",Mr_Shiftright," $52k?  i can buy some pretty nice iron for $52k--not sure i'd ever pay that for a ford. i'd buy it to use and enjoy. it'll be decades before it is 'collectible' (if ever) and by that time i'll probably be dead or senile, so that would not be my motivation."
"August 29, 2014  5:11PM",laurasdada," not sure if this or ccba board was where abacomike (and my thoughts continue to be with you and your family) was discussing mb e class vs. cls.  but, i was thinking my xf is kinda the hybrid/combo of those two  the style of the cls with the (not quite as spacious) room/utility of the e  sedan. my xf is really quite the swiss army knife  awd for the winter, (smallish) roof hole for lovely summer evenings, split, folding rear seat for suv-ish duties and a ski sack to put the sticks in the car, without messing up the fine corinthian leather.  not to mention, it plays dvds  ""it's not going to be an orgy!  it's a toga party!""  oh, yeah  340hp/332 lb.feet torque and a really nice ride/handling balance.  woo hoo. so, to sum up, stay calm and buy a jag!"
"August 29, 2014  5:35PM",driver100," some excellent reasons to go for the jag over, say an e class.  i believe you are talking v8 too! and, possibly saving $10 to $15k as well. i carry people around quite a bit, so backseat room is important to me, as well as easy getting in and out.  the e class and audi have seat that are the highest, backseat people have lots of depth, the floor is carved out.  even the 535 which people find comfortable doesn't have that. as you know, i didn't get to the jag dealer, i made a deal i was happy with and didn't want to jeopardize it, besides the e was as nice as a car could be for me, but, one concern i had were the number of dealerships....just in case of a breakdown in nowheresville usa.  i can imagine twiddling my thumbs in a motel 6 waiting for a part to be flown - courriered in. i do like your thinking on ruining your life by buying an ""e"" though...but, if you always worry about such things you might as well never do anything..."
"August 29, 2014  5:38PM",roadburner," the laguna seca adds the following to the standard boss 302 recaro sport seat, a torsen limited-slip rear differential (both optional on the standard boss 302), revised suspension tuning with unique spring and damper rates, and a larger rear stabilizer. the laguna seca model loses its rear seat, which are replaced by a cross-car x-brace to increase structural rigidity approximately 10%. it rides on 19x9-inch front (255/40-19) and 19x10 inch rear (285/35-19) light-weight alloy wheels with r-compound ultra high-performance tires. ford racing front brake ducts help cool the brakes. all nice, but imo not worth the $7000 premium over the standard boss 302."
"August 29, 2014  7:33PM",laurasdada," full disclosure on the xf  it'll seat 5, but if you're 6' or above, you probably won't be happy in the back seat.  unless you slouch anyway...  visibility is compromised by the styling, thick pillars all around.  a product of the sleek styling.  that's why i mention it is a blend of the cls and e.   and, it's a supercharged v6.  pricing is competitive in the class, i saved $ thanks to big trunk money and buying a '13 new year's eve '13. and, what?  me worry?  i bought a jag!  twice!  so, i worry not about such things.  looking forward to the xe, i hope it's not just a ""mini-xf."""
"August 29, 2014  7:40PM",tyguy," oh, nice.  i wish we could get 100% gas more readily in the usa.  the storage sta-bil will help prevent gasoline oxidation (stale gas), so still worth adding considering the very inexpensive cost of that version.  it'll help prevent varnish."
"August 29, 2014  7:43PM",graphicguy, that ford will get you laughed at every time you'd pull up to a stop light....at least around here it would.
"August 29, 2014  7:49PM",driver100," ahh, too bad, that's the deal killer for me."
"August 29, 2014  8:12PM",abacomike,
"August 29, 2014  9:16PM",driver100," it mkust have been the only car sold that day.  it wouldn't occur to me to buy a car on the day before new years.  not that we go out and party or anything.  were there other buyers in the showroom? one thing i really like in the e were the large windows all around, and the seating is very high.  even the backseat is like stadium seating...up high.  i compared it to the 535...i think it was the first time i ever sat in the rear seat.  the 535 is comfortable, but the e is even better in that regard. i have seen quite a few jaguars lately and i like the looks.  i think i like the last edition even more....very stately looking."
"August 29, 2014  9:16PM",fezo," just back in.  spent hours in a blood lab today for two ridiculously routine tests - the type the lab does dozens of every day.  problem was the wording on the new script.  two phone calls and a fax later that was resolved.  then, after pulling the needle they realize about the other test.  just one of those days.  everything that could go wrong... meanwhile my oldest is in the hospital.  she's bipolar which runs in my mom's family and pretty much people dealt with it.  it's just a long haul to find the right combination of things and you can lead a pretty normal life.  the other three are just fine.  it is a constant worry. mike, wishes and prayers continue.  you're doing what you're capable of - probably beyond that.  all you can do is have faith. while i am pleased to see driver using normal spelling for color (shows he has a sense of humour) i'll greatly disagree on the white is a color.  i get that whole white is all colors but a better definition is white is all colors canceling each other out.  if i had a white car i'd feel like i was driving a refrigerator. saw a new soul in a parking lot today.  first time i looked close at one.  now while i would never buy one i thought they were probably the best spin on driving a box.  not that i see the point but it looked downright attractive next to say and element or a nissan (faint praise indeed).  well, it looks like kia said ""where's the ugly stick?"" and batted around with it.  every change i see is for the worse. if i get to wanting a lot of space in not too big a package i'd do an outback or maybe a mazda. of course to get a mazda with a stick you have to forego a stick.  where's the fun in that?"
"August 29, 2014  9:17PM",ab348, hilarious but likely true. that's exactly the way i saw it playing out.
"August 29, 2014  9:20PM",driver100," sounds like you can do more looking after your dad at this point.  you sure have a lot to deal with mike, keep yourself as well as possible.  you are at your best for others when you are ok yourself.."
"August 29, 2014  9:25PM",driver100," good to hear from you again, glad you are back.  lol on your definition of white and your review of the soul.  and thanks for using the canadian spelling for ""humour"", you are very kind and <span style=""text-decoration line-through;"">  generous </span> person (oh, maybe not necessarily generous, but at least kind)."

"August 29, 2014 11:06PM",ab348," i visited the m-b dealer this evening to take a look at this, which was unveiled yesterday and sits in their showroom to me it looks rather unattractive in the photos i've seen but i thought perhaps it would come across better in person. unfortunately i arrived around 7pm and was greeted with a sign on the door saying that they are closed until tuesday due to the labor day weekend. ah well, it gave me a chance to wander the lot. i saw the diamond silver color finally, on a 2013 e350 that has appeared on their used lot. it really is a silver blue, much more blue than silver. the car seemed wildly overpriced at $59k. the new brown e350 i mentioned that i saw on my last visit had been moved, and i was surprised to find it unlocked! i did not want to get in it for fear of a security car barreling in to arrest me, but someone dropped the ball on that. this dealer really needs to take a few more chances on color selection for inventory. if you don't want a new car in either silver or black, with a black interior, they have almost nothing for you. btw, , they had on their used lot a 2010 xf, black over tan, with only 24,000km (&lt;15k miles) for $29k. handsome car."

"August 30, 2014  7:01PM",imidazol97," there's something wrong in the methodology of that survey relative to the conclusions they are drawing from the information. 4360 randomly-selected car owners who had bought within the last 3 years. as much as some might think i'd believe honda and bmw and audi belong in the bottom, i agree that the spread in point scores is too small. also, i suspect that people who are happy with their purchase of those car, have held onto them and haven't made a purchase within the last 3 years. that skews the survey. for the purposes of this survey, is 4 thousand a large enough number for a reasonable confidence level in the results for each broad grouping of car by manufacturer? i also want to know how these interviewed folks were selected. i used to be part of a federal government survey about crime (40 years ago). a person would show up about every 6 months and ask a list of questions as to any crimes with which i had observed or by which i was affected in my rural cincinnati community. there's something wrong here. it's like the surveys that say ""everyone"" is unhappy with their local public schools in the us, but then asked about their own local school people are usually satisfied. it's somewhat the same with people's evaluation of how government is operating."
"August 30, 2014  7:35PM",oldfarmer50, so i hear you saying you could do a better deal on an in stock unit over a dealer trade.  makes sense seeing there are extra costs involved with a dt. what about ordering a car configured to a specific customer's wishes?  assume that you will be taking delivery of a number of other car at the same time and the customer makes a firm commitment to buy so you had no worry of getting stuck with an oddball car. would you have done that deal with the same discounts as an in stock unit?

"August 30, 2014  9:49PM",oldfarmer50," hmmmmm, interesting. so it's the delay in booking the sale that makes car dealers adverse to ordering.  i see your point on the trade as well.  who knows what might happen in 2 months. so if i want my ford with cedodgeic color interior and a specific exterior color with no other options other than auto tranny i should not wait hoping to cut a better deal later in the year? if the best i'll get is msrp i might as well get exactly what i want as early as i can. you mention car being at the port ( as in a foreign manufacturer ).  might a dealer for a domestic brand feel different since he's not ordering a car from across the ocean?"
"August 30, 2014  9:55PM",ab348," i remember back when my dad was buying new car, the domestic dealers were quite willing to order a car to your specs. i think it was almost encouraged given the plethora of choices and options available back then. usually about 6 weeks later the exact car you wanted arrived. i can see it being  a bit different now given that most options are in packages and there is far less choice in terms of color combinations."

"August 31, 2014  2:13PM",driver100," gg, the 2015 will be out later in november, so that salesman was honest...ha. seems the 2015s will have a rear camera as standard equip on all models. interesating way to look at it......lower mileage per year at trade in time.  still, shouldn't there be a larger discount on a 2014 at this time of year?   if you had to trade the car in say in april or june of 2015 for some unknown reason, you would lose a full years depreciation...probably about $3000.  i know you probably want to turn the bmw in before it gets more miles on it, or you will have to extend the lease.  i get why you are doing what you are doing, just weigh all the options and maybe consider houdini's mazda 3....not sure if it is awd though. drivers personal rule for buying a current model at the end of the year is to do it if you plan on keeping the car for at least 6 or 7 years, or, if you absolutely need a car right now.  the savings rarely equal one year of depreciation.(though in your case i see what you are doing and does make sense - if you keep the car for at least 3 years imho)."

"August 31, 2014  7:12PM",driver100," in 1994 i took a course in how to be an entrepeneur.  one high flyer in the class wanted to be a marketing guy...pick up different lines and then promote them. he said he would buy about a 10 year old jaguar, they were fairly cheap, and since they basically look the same each year, clients will assume you can afford a (new) jaguar."
"August 31, 2014  7:47PM",Mr_Shiftright," well ""fake rich"" only works on other non-rich people, --so there might be some logic if your market was wanna-bees.  an actual scam-artist would just rent a new lexus, as might a legit person looking to pitch that one big deal to one big client. here in california, you have to pull a pretty big volkswagen out of the automotive box in order for anyone to take notice. maybe a brand new amg mercedes-benz benz or a tesla."
"August 31, 2014  8:11PM",driver100," that's true.  in approximately 1972, in my young and naive days, some guy got our number to sell golden products.  it was a pydodgeid scheme.  just buy about $10000 worth of soap, load up your garage, basement, and bedroom with boxes of soap, sell it to your friends, and you too could drive what he pulled up in.....just like this only red; i thought it was possible until we went to a meeting at some hotel and they showed a movie showing all these people smiling and talking about how golden products changed their lives and now they could live the good life.  the good thing was, it taught me to be skeptical about get rich schemes, nobody could be that happy unless they were on some kind of drug."

"September  1, 2014  1:18AM",abacomike,
"September  1, 2014  1:49AM",driver100," thanks for the answer, much appreciated. i think that if oldfarmer orders a ford the way he wants he should try to get a 5% discount.  no one really knows if 2015 ford are going to sell out.  he may get a better deal if he places an order, the first ones may get bought up right away by the fans, and then a dealer and ford will be glad to make him one. i would talk to a dealer.  order the car exactly the way you want it. you would have nothing to lose.  if you don't get it at the first dealer just walk. if you find one you like you can go for it, if not, just sit back and wait until the dust settles. it sounds like a lot of money, but, it won't mean a thing in the big scheme of things.  i probably overpaid for some car....but, i have no regrets - liked all my car and if i am out a few $$$$s, i wouldn't know it."

"September  1, 2014  1:55PM",jayrider," when it comes to the new ford and all the excitement -- i don't think i want the first few months of production. also, i would want a thorough test drive to make sure it lives up to my own expectations before i placed an order. probably takes a lot of the fun out of it but six months of  patience makes sense."
"September  1, 2014  2:00PM",snakeweasel," well i am back from the caribbean (hate the thought of going back to work tomorrow), well anyway, it would depend on the interest rates being offered. offer me 72 months at 0% and i will snap it up. i could always pay it off faster and i do keep car for longer than 72 months. you will even pay less with a 72 month loan at 1.5% than you will with a 48 month loan at 4%. so it would all depend on what the particulars are."
"September  1, 2014  2:26PM",driver100," i think it is worth a shot, the most the salesman can say is no.  we may think the 2015 is going to be a huge seller but what if it isn't as big as everyone seems to think.  there isn't much profit in selling car these days anyway.  the profit is in the servicing, and they really try to stick it to you there. no one wants to pay more than they have to, so by asking for 5% off you can get a sense of whether any discount is possible.  it might lead to a different strategy too, like wait for 5 months until the hoopla is over and there might be excess car in stock."

"September  1, 2014  3:20PM",abacomike," i have finally figured it all out about why the shows we don't watch or care to watch are doing so well via the emmy's and why the shows we did/do like are at the back of the pack.  here is my analysis *shows like ""everyone loves raymond"", ""frasier"", ""seinfeld"", ""two and a half men"" and the like, are situation comedies that require ""logic, cerebral analysis, deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, etc.,"" in order to appreciate the humor and the ""read between the lines"" punch lines, as well as excellent performers who deliver the humor.  additionally, shows like ""perry mason"", ""ironsides"", ""murder she wrote"", etc., were shows that required excellent actors to perform to perfection! today's situation comedies are very, very different - the actors are fed the lines and they deliver them as written without the need for the audience (us) to decipher or use advanced cerebral systems to derive the humor - it's put out there right in front of us and all we have to do is watch and listen. i remember the days of ""seinfeld"" when we would go to work the next morning and the discussion in the lounge or in the offices was all about, ""...did you see...what did you think about...wasn't that hysterical...it was just too funny the way jerry's parents...etc., etc., etc.,""  not any more - there is no show on tv that is good enough for people to gather around the lounge or water bottle and discuss, at length, the intracasies of the humor. so that's my analysis of today's shows vs. yester-years shows."
"September  1, 2014  3:37PM",oldfarmer50," i tend to agree with you.  besides, that would give me an extra 6 months to obsess. btw, the dealer from nj emailed me back and invited me to come in this morning at 9.  i guess he didn't know i was 160 miles away.  asked him again about the below invoice price. we'll see."
"September  1, 2014  3:45PM",oldfarmer50, be interesting to see what that car sells for.  there might some real enthusiasts who would like a piece of history.
"September  1, 2014  3:49PM",verdugo," we had an impreza back in 2005. it was my wife's car. we got rid of it 2 years later because it was too small for us. when going on any trip, it'd be a tight squeeze for the 2 of us. if friends came along, we looked like sardines. having said that, she still misses it and everytime when we see one driving around she gives me a hard time about selling ""her"" impreza. and my wife doesn't care about car at all. so if the size is right for you, i'm sure you'll do great. also subaru offers invoice minus x pricing if you're part of several organizations. iirc, you can join leave no trace and then get the discount. good luck."
"September  1, 2014  3:50PM",oldfarmer50, hondaing to edmunds there's about $2000 markup as i configured it. 5% would be $1775.  that would be a heck of a shot for a new model.
"September  1, 2014  4:13PM",Michaell," &gt; that may be true of today's sitcoms, but there are plenty of shows that folks talk about the next day - game of thrones is one, and breaking bad, when it was on, was another. another thing to consider about water cooler talk is that so many folks time-shift their viewing now with dvr, tivo's, apple tv and the like, so not everybody watches the show when it is originally aired."
"September  1, 2014  5:35PM",robr2," i'm not a fan of the show ""mom.""  even so, it's not a normal sitcom.  it deals with very heavy issues such as alcoholism and cancer.  everybody loves raymond and two and a half men wouldn't be able to could never be able to do that.  the latter i watch solely for mindless ford and there is very little there that stimulates my brain. imho, modern family is one of the best comedies on tv.  it's full of inside jokes and breaks down the fourth wall. i think the real issue here is the age of the viewer.  i think we all hearken back to the past and see things as better.  i see the crud that my 14 yo daughter watches on disney and teen nick and shake my head.  but then i realize, i'm not the person it's written for."

"September  1, 2014  7:54PM",driver100," yeh, but just go in acting dumb and you can ask for 5% off and he may come back at 3% off or 2.5. when i bought the e we agreed on the trade in first.  i didn't expect this fancy dealership to discount the e.  when he calculated the price i asked him where my 10% discount was.  we both laughed knowing that was ridiculous.  then i said it is a deal if you take 4% off.  he was really caught off guard, he hesitated, and then said yes.  it seems to me there was something that worked...maybe he knew i was serious but if i left he could lose me.  maybe it was better to make a sale without fussing around because i seemed to be knowledgeable.  maybe i should have tried for 6% off....who knows, but, if you are reasonable and are willing to come to a reasonable agreement, it should work.  of course, some dealers won't give much....that's just their business model......i'll have to have exhausted my options before i go down that road."
"September  1, 2014  8:21PM",driver100," i am not sure i am reading that right, but, the bmw 740 shown came after the 87 seville i am sure, and i think it was a slightly different look they were trying to achieve. the 87 seville looked more like this 1953 triumph mayflower.  there were many car in the 40s that had the bustleback design.  my guess is the seville designers were trying to capture the romance of another era....but, kind of bungled it. the rear end of that 7 series car was actually a scientific masterpiece in a way. new european designs were up against some heavy design padodgeeters. first, they had to deal with what were new euro-spec rear-crash protection standards, which were tougher than ever before.   bangle also had to deal with something tougher than a bunch of european bureaucrats — aerodynamics. it’s a sad fact of nature that if you want to cut wind resistance, keeping your vehicle low in the front and high in the back is a good rule of thumb. so, the car was designed to overcome these obstacles, and that's what it did...and sales numbers don't lie...people bought them. ithe bangle butt actually worked better on the 2003 to 2007 5 series, where it blended in more with the trunk.  these car actually look better today than they did when they were new.  they are very distinctive looking, and the styling gives it a stately appearance."
"September  1, 2014  8:29PM",imidazol97," the seville certainly wasn't modeled after the mayflower. as for bungling, i'm not convinced it was bungled.  i don't find any pictures of car which had the style the design was emulating. it was not accepted well and soon disappeared, at least until the bmw styling in the picture, which came later. i guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. what brand car are these?"
"September  1, 2014  9:22PM",roadburner," that '02 is interesting, but i'm not sure how much it's worth. the engine information is unique, but i'm not sure how big the market is for a decapitated and customized '02. i'd think it would be worth more if it still had a roof and stock trim. getting back to the engine swap, mchenry <strong>  was </strong> an engine guru in the bmw community,  but there are dozens of 2002s  running around with m20 and m5x engine swaps. there are even a few '02s equipped with e30 m3 motors- informally referred to a ""m2s"" as tweaked 2002s go, this is more my style"
"September  1, 2014  9:24PM",roadburner," i thought that the e65 7er and e60 bmw were stylistic abortions- just like the bustle-back seville. most bimmer enthusiasts vilified the ""bangle butt."""

"September  2, 2014  2:36AM",imidazol97," we agree on that. i like the 57 ford high line much better than the chevrolet. must be the engine or maybe the chevrolet had better handling, etc., that made it the preferred vehicle of many. was the ford a truly new car compared to the 56 ford or was it just a different body poured onto the same chassis? that idea sticks in my memory from somewhere; as new as the ford looks, it was based on the earlier chassis. i had a 57 as my first car of my own in the household. 2-door sedan with fake chrome over the posts to mimic a hardtop. neat."
"September  2, 2014 11:24AM",driver100," there is a great 57 ford site that says the 57 ford was technologically advanced in many ways at the time.  here is part of what it said; for 1957.....there's a big new kind of ford with the touch of tomorrow!  this brilliant new automotive package is bigger, easier to enter, roomier than ever. yet it's lower...so low that a man of average height can rest his elbows comfortably on its top!  and longer....you're never seen such graceful contour of its sculptured-in-steel body says, ""let's go"" what kind of magic made this miracle possible?  it all started with a new inner ford.  for ford engineers reinvented the automobile.  they developed a revolutionary contoured fdodgee......a built-for-keeps body...a new type of low-slung drive...a new level-ride suspension....a wide range of new higher-compression engines.  these are but a few of the reasons why this kind of ford rides silent, solid and secure. i remember the ads showed a businessman could sit in the drivers seat and reach down and pick up his briefcase, because the car was so low. this gives the idea of how low the 57 ford was; if you go on the site there are lots of good sections...history, color choices, ads etc."

"September  2, 2014  3:50PM",abacomike," my grandfather had a '57 chevrolet belair sedan until 1962 and my other grandfather had a '57 ford sedan until 1965.  way back then, people kept their car much longer than they do today. i remember driving both of them when i got my license in 1961 and i would have to agree with you that the chevrolet handled much better than the ford.  the ford seemed to fishtail more and the weight distribution was awful.  the ford seemed a bit more powerful than the chevrolet and the  ford was lower to the center of gravity than the chevrolet. in short, the ford was bulkier and bouncier than the chevrolet!"
"September  2, 2014  3:53PM",isellhondas," i grew up (?) in a "" chevrolet town"" but i know there were ""ford towns"" too. 1957 ford were said to have poor workmanship compared to the chevrolets and i remember a 283 equipped chevrolet could flat walk away from a 312 ford. a 1957 dodge d500 could make either look like a six cylinder."
"September  2, 2014  4:30PM",robr2," that only applies to you mike!! in reality, people are keeping car longer and longer.  back in 1970 (first year i could find data for), the average age of car was 5.6 years.  in 2000, it was 9 years.  today, it's 11.4 years. i look at my three car and i'm at 8.8 years average."
"September  2, 2014  6:03PM",laurasdada," check out shophq.com for a treasure trove of invicta watches (and many other ""made for tv"" brands...).  oftentimes with 6 payments same as cash.  similar discounts across the board.  for some reason, when i come across their watch show on tv (sunday/monday nights, sometimes more.  i think they sell a lot of watches on tv!), i get mesmerized (being a psuedo-watch guy). i've got a couple from them, not fancy, but functional, especially my diver watch w/japanese automatic movement."
"September  2, 2014  7:13PM",driver100," i heard that number the other day...average age of a car today is 11 years!  i am wondering if a reason is because people have more 2nd car these days, and so the mileage gets broken up between them, and one car won't be used nearly as much. when i heard that statistic they said it was because todays car last longer.  it seems to me that you could probably get 200 or 300k miles out of a car today fairly easily....i don't remember car going more than much over 100k in the good old days...50s and 60s."
"September  2, 2014  7:19PM",driver100," my father had a 57 ford, my uncle a 57 chev, and i think i would say the same.  the chev was pretty rock solid, the ford...not so much.  i believe chev made a much better 6 cyl engine, but ford was good with their 8s.  chevrolets were finished off nicer, and somehow that style became a classic, i think because of the bullets on the hood.  ford certainly looked more modern at the times...longer, lower, wider......but futuristic isn't always better for nostalgia purposes."
"September  2, 2014  7:24PM",driver100, one more....when wagons looked like wagons.....
"September  2, 2014  8:07PM",robr2," in 1970, there were were 89.2 million registered car in america and a population of 203.3 million - so about 43% penetration.  in 2010, there was about 252.4 million registered car and a population of 308.7 million - 82% penetration.  i think it's more car per family/household and that the car of today can go much longer than in 1970. when i was a kid, my dad used to get a car every 3 years.  mind you, he drove a lot - maybe 15k miles a year and he didn't trust car beyond 50k.  my mom eventually got a car because she worked and she couldn't take the bus to work anymore.  very few families in my neighborhood had two car and i recall many who didn't have one at all. today, there are 3 car in my household and some homes in my neighborhood have a car for every kid and adult."
"September  2, 2014  8:09PM",stickguy, car lasting longer and people keeping them longer is not the same thing.
"September  2, 2014  8:19PM",abacomike,
"September  2, 2014  9:14PM",driver100," that's about how i remember it too.  my dad travelled for a living and got a car at about every 50k miles, which was usually every other year.  since he travelled we always had a 2nd car for my mother.  since his car was important...his livelihood, i could only drive the 2nd car, once a volkswagen, once a hillman, and once a corvair.  no other families had 2 car for quite awhile. i guess that's where i find it hard to share my car.  like i told my wife, i don't let anyone else use my toothbrush, my underwear, or my car."
"September  2, 2014  9:24PM",stever," my dad had a drugstore and my mom was a nurse, and they always had two car as long as i can remember. dad's favorite was a '53 buick special that lasted forever. he got it new and i got stopped by a trooper in it when i was 13. he finally sold it a couple of years later, rotten floorboards and all. mom meanwhile got a new wagon every 3 years or so. when i got my license she had switched to a gmc truck that she kept longer than usual and then got an chevrolet that she drove at least a decade. her last car was a protege that she drove 15 years before she quit driving. mostly i remember those old car in the 50s and 60s always having flats, overheating, and being in the shop a lot of the time."
"September  2, 2014  9:25PM",stickguy, i hate the idea of the attendant at the dealer driving my car in for service.  i might have a stroke if i had to lend it to someone to use.  which is why i made sure to have something to share with my daughter that i had no real interest in!
"September  2, 2014  9:38PM",ab348," awhile back i did a mental inventory of the car dad had when i was growing up and i was astounded at how often he traded car. he went into the real estate business in the early '60s and had to have a decent car to take clients around in, but i had no idea he traded as frequently as he did. before my time '55 ford sedan (his first brand new car) '56 ford crown vic (first car i have a vague memory of) '59 ford '61 meteor '62 ford consul (british) '63 pontiac laurentian (chevrolet belair trim level) '65 pontiac parisienne (4-dr ht) '63 pontiac parisienne (business setback caused him to trade down) '66 olds dynamic 88 (4-dr ht, loved this car) '67 ponitac parisienne (4-dr ht) '69 chevrolet chevrolet sport coupe (awful car) '71 dodge monaco (4-dr ht, great car) '68 volvo 144 (gas crisis car) '73 volvo 144 '74 ford maveric '75 amc hornet sportabout '78 ponitac lemans grand safari '79 chevrolet chevrolet ;81 olds omega '84 dodge aries wagon '90 dodge dynasty (his last ride)"
"September  2, 2014  9:56PM",graphicguy," like ld said, there are a bunch of those ""made for discounting"" watch brands out there.  i'm wearing an invicta right now with a miyota automatic movement.  keeps great time.  i can knock around in it.  i think i paid less than $!00 for it 2-3 years ago.  i've taken showers with it.  worked in the yard with it.  washed car with it.  played volkswagen with it.  aside from some desk rash on the underside of the band, it looks new.  probably have received more compliments on it than i ever did on a $3k+ tag huer i wear when i dress up (which is also a favorite brand on cruise ships). some of the other ""high value"" watches out there in addition to invicta.....stauer, skagen, android, renato, stuhrling, swiss legend. and a bunch more at that ""shophq.com"" site (which used to be shop nbc).. heck...i""ve seen some pretty nice deals on those citizen watches on cruise ships.  and, citizen makes some pretty nice watches. other sites.... jomashop.com worldofwatches.com"
"September  2, 2014 10:30PM",koctailz," ok confession time for me....i got screwed on my recent lease. the sad thing is i know better as i have leased car before but this dealer zinged me. it was a ford dealer. here is the story...i emailed several dealers to get the best price on the vehicle. i was actually at first going to purchase and then later decided to lease. so i got the dealer where i had originally test drove the car to match the price of another dealer, this was a very good price...about $1k under invoice. so i march in friday evening to do the deal. they run my credit..it comes back at 785 and i ask if that qualifies me for the best lease rate...the sales rep says yes. usually when i lease i always use edmunds to try and find the money factor, residual, etc. for this vehicle though i could not find a forum where this info was available. this made me fell a little uneasy but i had never had a dealer manipulate either on me...so i went with trust....first mistake. they drew up the papers and the monthly payment was in line with a quote i had received from anotehr dealer about a week earlier. so a few days go by and i talk to a friend who leased the same car and his payment is much lower. i compare our leases. my rent charge is 4 times higher than his. ouch. the lease apr money factor is .25 for this vehicle hondaing to kyfdx...i finally was able to contact him for this info. i was charged 2.7%. information is power in any negotiation and unfortunately i didn't have all the info prior to signing. i specifically asked the dealer if my credit qualified me for best lease rate and they said yes. that was an obvious lie and that really gets me. at this point i don't think i have any recourse....or do i? would appreciate any advice on the topic."
"September  2, 2014 10:50PM",isellhondas, that six that ford was building in those days were actually pretty good engines that lasted a long time.  i'll give an edge to the chevrolet 235's though. the y block ford just couldn't match the performance of the 265/283's that chevrolet used. they also had upper oiling problem which became even worse if pennzoil or quaker state oils were used.
"September  2, 2014 11:02PM",abacomike,
"September  2, 2014 11:28PM",driver100," mike's answer seems right on koctailz.  he's the one who sold car. what the heck is a ""rent charge""? also, out of curiosity, what are your buy back rates like?  this doesn't look like a factor here, but occassionally that can make a difference in rates."
"September  2, 2014 11:39PM",jayrider," a local dealer [big one] said that when he started selling car in the early 60's there were lots of folks driving ""old car.""  i guess he meant beaters.  he said that now you rarely see really old car that show their age. he makes sense since even folks who can't afford a decent car can get one thanks to subprime lending. bodies and paint are holding up better too."
"September  2, 2014 11:45PM",explorerx4," , paying 4 times as much interest seems like a big deal on the surface, but it would help to know, what vehicle did you lease? maybe you are only paying a few extra bucks and you lost bragging rights."
"September  2, 2014 11:55PM",stever," i thought that only new jersey had any sort of cooling off period for leasing and it was just 24 hours for you to review to contract? , you can write up a here (and on yelp, google+, dealer rater, etc.). venting may not help get your deal redone, but it'll put more people on notice that they need to pay attention to the numbers, especially at this dealer."
"September  3, 2014 12:05AM",abacomike,
"September  3, 2014 12:14AM",stever, seems to help to get prequalified and invite the dealer to meet or beat your rate if you finance. dealers make money just packaging loans right? so you may get a better rate than your bank or cu gave you and the dealer can still make a few bucks.
"September  3, 2014 12:21AM",abacomike,
"September  3, 2014 12:24AM",stever, lots of buyers are surprised by that - guess most of them expect to take it in the shorts on everything at the dealer.
"September  3, 2014  1:19AM",henryn," &gt; i haven't seen rates go up.  not on car loans. mortgages, yes, car loans, no.  i belong to 3 credit unions, one is at 1.59%, and the other two are at 1.99%.  a year ago, the low was 1.99 and the high was 2.49, from the same 3 credit unions."
"September  3, 2014  1:57AM",nyccarguy," the plot thickens i received a follow up email from the dealership here in stamford ""we recently provided you with a quote for a subaru impreza. please confirm you have received it-feel free to give me a call or reply this email."" so i fired an email back saying that i'm interested in a legacy instead of the impreza. 2.5i premium with eyesight. i list the vehicle's msrp &amp; invoice just to make certain he knows what i'm looking for. he then quickly replies ""you got the msrp perfect, invoice is $24,622, you can order for that amount plus $379 conveyance for a taxable $25,001. please allow 8-12 weeks for delivery."" no we are getting somewhere. i'm going to see if i can drive it tomorrow after work. interesting point that he's telling me the invoice is $24,622, but when i calculate it here on edmunds, it comes out to $24,277.  why the $345 discrepancy?"
"September  3, 2014  2:04AM",abacomike,
"September  3, 2014  2:11AM",nyccarguy," there's definitely ""hidden profit,"" the dealer's fee is $379, &amp; he's lying to me)."
"September  3, 2014  2:16AM",abacomike,
"September  3, 2014  2:48AM",mako1a, maybe the dealer just had a new toilet installed and when the dealer got the bill for the toilet he asked why so much and the plumber said parts are high and he said where do you get your parts and he said from bradd. bada bing an extra $379.
"September  3, 2014  2:57AM",stickguy," that lease discussion is a perfect segue to my story from tonight.  stopped to test out an honda.  at the end, asked for a lease quote.  salesdude wanders off.  i predict they are going back at about $300. she takes over, and wins.  comes back at $1500 down, about $348/mo.  seems nuts.  so i ask for residual and mf.  57% (seemed low, but was on a 2014).  but mf was .0027, or 6.14%!  ouch. so, i question the numbers, and get a response about how they take worst case and show that, just in case your credit is crap, so they don't have to up the quote.  never saw that before.  plus, some of the fees did not even apply.  about the only ""real"" number was was the selling price (which was actually pretty good i think). when i questioned everything (and converted the mf to an interest rate), he acted almost guilty and tried to explain how when they ran credit, if it was good the payment would go down.  yeah, right.  more likely if you had no clue, and just bit on the payment (seeing the big discount on the top line), guess what, you were getting that payment! i was explain this to the wife while we were waiting.  she had no clue how it worked, or the shell game they were doing, which imo was exactly the point. once i flagged it all, and was ready to leave, the manager came over, promising me his best ""wow me"" price, assuming i really did have good credit.   and of course, pushing to take it tonight.  that payment (same sales price) suddenly dropped to $275.  slightly more in line with what i was expecting. they actually had the same trick on the buy section.  a nice matrix of dp and monthly nut, just at the 3.29% ""mediocre credit"" rate, instead of the .09% good credit hfc rate.  pretty sure anyone that did not question it was getting bumped. really rubbed me the wrong way.  not that it would matter to me in the end, but still, just seemed sleazy."
"September  3, 2014  3:01AM",stickguy," jersey has no cooling off recourse.  you sign your name and drive over the curb, and you own it."
"September  3, 2014  3:19AM",mako1a," _ drive over the curb, and you own it._ i wonder how long you can leave the car there before the contract sets in stone."
"September  3, 2014  3:23AM",abacomike,
"September  3, 2014  4:10AM",mako1a," next time i buy a new car and it's sitting in the new car delivery space, i think i'll order chinese just to see how long i can go before making the transaction ""official""."
"September  3, 2014  4:12AM",abacomike,
"September  3, 2014  4:16AM",mako1a," when you drive off, do the salesguys put a tick mark on the board and do high fives?"
"September  3, 2014  4:17AM",stickguy," at the honda dealer i was at tonight, they actually ring a big bell when a sale is made."
"September  3, 2014  4:19AM",abacomike,
"September  3, 2014  4:22AM",abacomike,
"September  3, 2014  4:22AM",mako1a," when i dumped the old bronco on them trading for the first ford the salesguy asked why i traded it in. i responded...""i heard you guys were big laydowns"" he laughed pretty good."
"September  3, 2014 11:45AM",driver100," seems to me there are two kinds of dealers.  one kind is pretty good in that they give you a decent price up front, you do have to work a bit at getting a good discount and a good trade allowance...but, once they know you are knowledgeable they go with the flow and don't play games.  the sales manager at the audi dealership - which is in a high income area said, we deal with business people so they know the score. the other kind of dealer you have to watch like a hawk.  they are out to get you any way they can.  the volkswagen dealer in st petes started out like that but once i told them it was their last chance...my price or i walk they came around.  i think it is the way of the business...they test the waters to see what they can get a way with."
"September  3, 2014 11:46AM",robr2, is it a ct dealer?  if so then that is new england subaru's charge.  remember the new england states have a distributor (ernie boch) and they charge more than surrounding states.
"September  3, 2014 11:48AM",driver100," i watched a progdodge once (could have been 60 minutes) where these guys were selling really crappy used car.  on one car they actually glued the door handle onto the door. some guy came in, bought the car, and drove off. the salesmaen were sitting around laughing their heads off and giving high fives at the moron who bought the car....nice!"
"September  3, 2014 12:12PM",imidazol97," that's a lot better than the ""paging dr. firestone to 1345 stat"" follow by some other code pages."
"September  3, 2014  1:50PM",ab348," i didn't know that boch was their distributor. i wonder if you can get a better deal if you buy a subie from one of his dealerships. i don't know how i feel about ernie boch. we get the boston tv stations on cable here and a few years ago he was all over them, doing his own commercials with his ""come on down!"" schtick, appearing on phantom gourmet and picking up the tab with his amex black card for this over-the-top dinner thing they did, etc. lately though he only appears in animations preceding pbs shows that he sponsors and they show him with long hair, rockstar facial hair, etc., looking not at all like the slick car salesman ernie boch. he seems to like playing music now. i gather he is as wealthy as midas. i understand his grandfather started it all with a dodgebler dealership back in the '40s/'50s. how things have changed."
"September  3, 2014  2:01PM",nyccarguy," i didn't think about that.  subaru of america is a separate distributor from subaru of new england.  i'm so close to ny &amp; work in ny that sometimes i forget i actually live in new england)  so the guy 10 minutes down i-95 in rye, ny should have cheaper pricing plus a $75 doc fee as opposed to a $379 doc fee."
"September  3, 2014  2:27PM",Michaell," i'm working the pga tournament in denver this week - i'm on the vip player transportation committee, which allows me to drive bmw's to and fro (x5d's and 750il's for the most part). anyway, rory's manager and agent come into the transportation tent with a question. one of them has a box that he sets on the desk. turns out it's the claret jug rory won back in july at the british open. and, we were allowed to hold it! i know the picture is sideways - edmunds does that with pictures from my iphone. this was the highlight of my week."
"September  3, 2014  2:45PM",stever," common issue apparently with exif. only real fix it seems, at least for viewing on desktop browsers, is to edit the photo to rotate it, save and post the new version."
"September  3, 2014  3:19PM",roadburner, my son went to the pga championship at valhalla; on sunday he ran into one of his friends and got to sit in a reserved seat at 18 with her and her father(her father is loaded- i keep asking rb jr. why he isn't dating her)
"September  3, 2014  3:21PM",oldfarmer50," man, you should see some of the beaters that roll around in salt states.  once the body starts to rot it doesn't make sense to throw money away on mechanical repairs. i've owned several older car with relatively low milage that turned to crud.  when things like mirrors broke or seat ripped or fenders got dented it was strictly duct tape time."

"September  3, 2014  3:33PM",oldfarmer50, my guess is the ad fee.  does edmunds list one?
"September  3, 2014  3:42PM",oldfarmer50," ha ha ha maybe bradd should start charging a ""flush fee"" on all his products."
"September  3, 2014  3:50PM",isellhondas," buyer's remorse can be painful. people buy or lease car and then they talk to others to find out they paid too much. or did they?  i've seen a lot of bragging and puffery in internet forums.  i've seen ""prices paid"" that i know never happened. did these people ""forget"" what they actually paid?  was a trade in under valued? my best advise is, once a purchase has been made, forget it and just enjoy your new car or whatever it is you bought. if you go to a forum and ask "" did i pay too much""? i can guarantee someone will quickly rain on your parade!"
"September  3, 2014  4:08PM",koctailz," thanks for all the info guys... rent charge description shows...the amount charged in addition to the depreciation and any amortized amounts...i have always understood this to be the total amount of interest paid on the lease. this is in california, maybe different states do it different? also $15950 is residual. i leased a 2014 ford ford energi. i bought it for the carpool stickers basically! this vehicle receives a $6500 lease rebate and the way that is calculated in the lease is very convoluted and i spent a lot of time reviewing this instead of the lease rate. as far as getting pre-qualified, sure for a loan that is simple, but for a lease i don't see how that is possible? i will definitely review the dealer on here, yelp, etc but there ratings are so bad  to begin with i don't think it would hurt them anyway. i wanted to do the deal with a local dealer as that is where i test drove, i dealt with their internet dept thinking that would help me cut through some of the b.s., the sales guy was very informative and knowledgeable. i am insurance agent and could send them business if they gave me a fair deal. yes, i signed the deal and it's on me, but i really do not like being lied to like i was and i will let the dealer know this when i visit. i will definitely not service my vehicle there, etc. in some ways i feel the customers and the dealers are to blame for this sort of trickery. many customers now will email many dealers in the area and disect the deal and suck every last penny to make sure they are getting the best deal possible. there are so many places now to find info on vehicle prices, edmunds, truecar, etc. the dealers feel backed into a corner and have to resort to lies and trickery to make some $. i don't blame them in many ways, but in the long run i feel they lose out with a bad reputation and losing lots of referral business."
"September  3, 2014  4:16PM",isellhondas," what you say is true.  shoppers come in determined to squeeze every last penny out of a deal.  they think making a profit is something evil.  they spend weeks pitting dealer against dealer in their zeal to buy a car for the lowest price. i've literally seen people drive hundreds of miles in order to ""save"" 200.00 on a car. so, a lot of dealers fight back by trying to make a decent profit deal once in awhile. nothing wrong with that unless they get dishonest. they told you that you qualified for the best money factor.  they just didn't give it to you. it sounds like you already knew they had bad reviews yet you still did business with them? it's no wonder the business has the turnover that it has. as far as repeat and referral business.  i know in my last few years, i thrived on this business but, sadly, some of my ""loyal"" customers could have been lured elsewhere for a few bucks. service customers were the same way.  they were ""loyal"" until the warranties ran out."
"September  3, 2014  4:25PM",roadburner," my philosophy has been to find a dealer with an honest and competent sales and service department- <strong>  <em>   and stick with them  </em> </strong> . sure, i might save a couple of hundred bucks running all over the place shopping prices, but for me it simply isn't worth it. my bmw and mazda dealers both give me first-class treatment and i'm not about to throw them overboard to save a few dollars here or there..."
"September  3, 2014  4:30PM",isellhondas," i share your philosophy but, sadly, the world seems to have changed and loyalty seems to have been all but forgotten. were it not for my loyal customers i would have left the business long before i did."
"September  3, 2014  4:41PM",roadburner," i think of the old saying about those who know the price of everything but the value of nothing. and while i might look at another brand of vehicle-doubtful-if i am buying a new or cpo bmw or mazda i will only go to ""my"" dealerships."
"September  3, 2014  4:42PM",abacomike,
"September  3, 2014  4:45PM",koctailz," ... ""they told you that you qualified for the best money factor. they just didn't give it to you"" that is semantics...say what you mean. you can arrange the words however you want but to me its a lie. like i said i am an insurance agent and also for me if it were not for my loyal customers i probably would be out of business as well and that loyalty has to be earned and maintaned every day in every interaction with my clients. of course one big differencet between my business and car sales is i have renewal commison and in auto sales you are only as good as your last sale. in the insurance industry we are seeing a real emphasis on price...especially in auto insurance. this is due to the constant geico, etc advertising emphasizing the lowest price. it's a race to the bottom. then when someone has a claim they find out in many cases they get what they paid for."

"September  3, 2014  9:08PM",robr2," nope - boch doesn't have a subaru dealership.  i think it might be due to boch enterprises owning subaru of new england - not wanting to compete with his customers.  besides, sofne gets a cut of every car sold and is the exclusive supplier of subaru accessories in new england. i don't know how i feel about ernie boch. we get the boston tv stations on cable here and a few years ago he was all over them, doing his own commercials with his ""come on down!"" schtick, appearing on phantom gourmet and picking up the tab with his amex black card for this over-the-top dinner thing they did, etc. lately though he only appears in animations preceding pbs shows that he sponsors and they show him with long hair, rockstar facial hair, etc., looking not at all like the slick car salesman ernie boch. he seems to like playing music now. i gather he is as wealthy as midas. i understand his grandfather started it all with a dodgebler dealership back in the '40s/'50s. how things have changed. ernie boch, jr.'s grandfather started it all with a nash dealership back in the 40's.  his father, ernie, sr. built that into one of the biggest dodgebler dealerships in the us and addeded dodge as well.  he was one of the first toyota dealers and started the subaru distributorship.  he is the one credited with creating the ""automile"" in norwood, ma and is the originator of the ""we pay cash for our car so we pay less and pass the savings on to you.  come on down."" jr. grew up in the business and is still the owner.  my understanding is that he has surrounded himself with smart managers and is very intelligent about the business.  but he knows when to take the advice of his managers.  he is in his mid 50's and seems to be going through a mid-life crisis with the long hair, van [non-permissible content removed] and the band.  but music has always been a big part of his life and he uses it as the basis of his foundation. today, boch has 2 toyota, 2 scion, 2 honda dealerships and a ferrari/maserati store. and yes, he's loaded. here's sr. <span class=""videowrap"">  <span class=""video youtube"" data-youtube=""youtube-qckkpzrywau?autoplay=1"">   <span class=""videopreview"">   </span>   <span class=""videoplayer"">   </span>  </span> </span> and jr. with his kids <span class=""videowrap"">  <span class=""video youtube"" data-youtube=""youtube-ydzhzaudiqcvo?autoplay=1"">   <span class=""videopreview"">   </span>   <span class=""videoplayer"">   </span>  </span> </span>"

"September  3, 2014  9:53PM",oldfarmer50, sometimes ignorance is bliss. a guy at work just leased a 2014 honda chrysler for $89/ month.  he was very proud of this.  seeing that some members of this board are doing the same i inquired about the deal. he said he got the deal by putting $4000 down! i think he could have gotten $198/ month with $1000 down and $260/ month with zero down. he had no idea what his money factor was but he did say his wife went for $700 mop and glo. i didn't want to rain on his parade.
"September  3, 2014  9:57PM",explorerx4," . mike's point about the sales survey does show you have some leverage. i'm sure the salesperson said something like, 'you may be getting a survey in the mail from ford motor company. if for any reason you can't complete it as completely satisfied, let us know.' maybe you can think of something reasonable to negotiate. i doubt if they are going to renegotiate the contract, though. one caveat, you have to actually get the survey. i had a bad sales/delivery experience one time, and couldn't wait to fill it out, but it never showed up. i called customer service and told them i never got the survey. they said it was sent out and asked to verify my information. it turns out my address was listed in the town where i bought the car, over 40 miles from where i lived at the time. it was probably the salesperson's address."
"September  3, 2014 10:06PM",mako1a, radar detectors are illegal in virginia so this is the first i've heard about geico not insuring rd drivers. probably a good thing for me as i don't want to get used to waiting for a beep to slow down.
"September  3, 2014 10:31PM",driver100," he has a great business model...he pays cash, gets the car for less, so you save.  also, the rural address probably helps. i am sure his toyota and ferrari/maserati stores will thrive, not so sure about scion, i saw they were on a top 10 list of car companies that may not last too long in n.a."
"September  3, 2014 10:31PM",koctailz, i did receive a survey in my email from i was planning on blasting them on it. i was also planning on talking to finance manager or sales manager regarding my experience and do so in a polite manner. i know yelling and swearing never ends with a good result. i will bring up the survey and ask them how much a good review is worth to them.$$. i have a feeling they don't give a crap. all of the ford dealers in my area have poor online reviews. you have to go out of the bay area a bit to find some that have better reviews. also when i bought the car by the time we were done it was 9pm on friday and dealer was closed and didn't have time to prep and wash car. they told me to call and come back to get it washed. i have called 3 times with no call back. im making sure these guys wash the car even if i have to drive it onto the showroom floor.
"September  3, 2014 10:32PM",driver100," i didn't want to rain on his parade lol...i thought he had a great deal, until i saw the $4000 down....ouch! kind of defeats the whole idea of leasing."
"September  3, 2014 10:32PM",henryn," &gt; back in the early 90's, when they were still doing the surveys by usps, i had a dodge dealer offer me $100 to bring him the survey instead of sending it back directly to chrysler.  i turned him down."

"September  3, 2014 10:55PM",explorerx4," , for some reason, i thought they are still snail mailed. how easy would it be to have the sale department substitute they own drop box email as the destination for the surveys, then fill them out themselves? they could even send their own fake survey by email, if they were sleazy and halfway smart. i would verify that email is the correct delivery system for the survey."

"September  3, 2014 11:45PM",driver100," route 1 sounds pretty rural...maybe the nash dealership started in the country and now it has become more urban.  that begs a question i have often wondered about. could it be cheaper to buy from a small town dealership where property costs, taxes, etc are cheaper?  seems some of these giant used car places are outside the city including haldimand motors near me.....it is north americas largest used car dealer and they are definitely in a very small town. over 500 used car"

"September  4, 2014  1:11AM",robr2," it was rural perhaps 100 years ago but route 1 was the main highway between boston and providence before the interstate system.  as an fyi, rt. 1 runs from ft. kent, me to key west, fl.  today in that area it's a 4 lane divided road with car dealers, restsaturnnts, shopping, hotels, et al.  it's anything but rural.  it has a population of 20k and is solidly chevrolet just like most places 25 minutes outside of boston. you might save a bit but imho, a larger more metro dealer probably turns more car and hence can sell at a lower price.  maybe a used car lot might do better. he would still have 2 dealerships.  scion is co-located inside the toyota stores.  afaik, there are very few free standing scion stores as the volume doesn't justify it."

"September  4, 2014  9:27AM",oldfarmer50, lol that would be the ultimate in sleazy behavior.  last two new car i bought i never got a survey from the manufacturer.  got something from j. d. power which i tossed.  if that was the csi i couldn't tell.  i mentioned it to the salesman for my mitsu and he seemed indifferent.  didn't act like he had any money riding in it. maybe the survey went to his house too.
"September  4, 2014 10:54AM",qbrozen," is it 36-mo? because, actually, rule of thumb on a lease says $30 change in payment per $1k down. so his $0 down number would have been $209. doesn't sound bad to me."

"September  4, 2014 11:42AM",nyccarguy," i'm one step closer to taking the plunge and punching my ccba card. i stopped by the subaru dealer in rye, ny where i drove the impreza last week. this time i stopped by to put the newly redesigned 2015 subaru legacy through its paces. my test model was a legacy limited. i sat in the car and adjusted its mirrors while my sales guy attached a demo plate. dash materials are very high quality and soft touch plastics are everywhere. the seat are padded very hard, almost with a mercedes-benz benz-like stiffness. foot on the brake, shift into drive, &amp; off i go. i immediately notice how much more responsive the 2.5l is compared to the 2.0 l in the impreza. the steering does provide decent feedback for being electric, but its still too light for my tastes (to make matter worse, i drove my bmw today). i hopped on the highway. the engine pulls strongly while the cvt responds to every stab of the throttle. this car will have absolutely no trouble keeping up traffic at the normal 70 - 75 mph clip i usually cruise at. my biggest issue with the dashboard is its layout. the tach is on the right and the speedo is on the left (my honda and my bmw have tach on the left &amp; speedo on the right). this is going to take some getting used to. the ride is definitely on the taut side of comfortable. which is fine by me. it rides very close to an old school honda before they started softening up the suspensions to market to the toyota crowd. there is a bit more body roll than i like &amp; i'm used to, but again i'm comparing it to my bmw &amp; my prelude (with thicker sway bars) so take that with a grain of salt. handling characteristics are pretty neutral. i took an off dodgep a bit faster than i should have (kept looking down at the tach, thinking it was the speedo) and the legacy definitely didn't under steer. brakes seemed pretty good. pedal feel was linear and progressive. i'm spoiled by my 328xi's stellar stoppers though. as you can all tell, i liked the car a lot. i parked the car and went back into the showroom. the sales guy asks what i think. then says ""you'll be happier with the legacy coming from a bimmer."" i tell him i like it and am interested in a 2.5i premium w/ eyesight. we go inside &amp; he brings his manager over. the manager says, ""didn't i see you here last week with a different car?"" he asks me some questions about my bmw then asks me if i plan to lease or finance. the manager tells me that the eyesight car will most likely come in around the end of october, early november. he says ""thanks for stopping by."" then my salesman pulls out the binder off his desk. opens it up, punches the invoice number in for the car &amp; the eyesight option into a calculator. he says we can order you the car for this. we are low pressure here. take a day, a week, a month. i'm not going to call you or email you as i sense you seem to know what you want. so now, what do i do? should i lease a base 2.5i car for 3 years? lease or finance a 2.5i premium? or factory order a 2.5i premium w/ eyesight?"
"September  4, 2014 11:46AM",robr2," that's true but as i said, he's a pretty smart guy.  he grew up in the business and was running most of it while his dad was alive.  here's a pretty good article with some of his rules for entrepreneurship"
"September  4, 2014 12:05PM",bwia," ernie boch jr. is a shrewd businessman. rather than become one of those mega multi-brand dealerships his strategy is to be #1 in a few brands. for example, his honda and toyota dealerships are #1 in new england and i believe were #1 in the nation. over the years i have purchased an olds cutlass (1988), a honda civic (2002) and a toyota toyota (2000) from the boch organization. the olds dealership is now a used car and repair shop, doing a bang-up job with insurance claims and repairs. btw, i believe ernie jr. has his own jet (the norwood airport is just across the street) and is known to fly to distant places just for a pizza or to play with his band. eccentric or spoiled millionaire, you decide."
"September  4, 2014  1:08PM",driver100," good review nyc...i felt like i was right in the car with you, and i could empathize with what you are trying to accomplish.  get a car that will be satisfactory enough but come within budget. i think, to answer your question.... lease or finance a 2.5i premium? or factory order a 2.5i premium w/ eyesight? it depends on the monthly cost of each, and what your budget will allow.  i wouldn't give up anything you really want for a few bucks a month or you will become disatisfied and it may cost you more to get out of it.  leasing is good if it gets you through a tough time and gives you some flexibility, though getting out of a lease can be costly. i would factory order at this time of year, but, as you said you have a reason why you don't.  i think it is best and not much more to drive a one year newer car.  i wouldn't get the base model though, get it the way you want it. the driver rule of thumb about life  buy what you want within reason, plan your life in a positive way so you will move forward and will like the things you buy and get, but, have a back up plan just in case (kind of a worse case senario plan).  tell us what your thoughts are."

"September  4, 2014  7:50PM",stever," whenever i see their ads, i think how much cheaper their insurance would be if they weren't spending so much money on marketing. ditto progressive. but i'll buy on price (i've had the same insurance for four years - that's a record for me, but i'll go with a new company soon since we've moved)."
"September  4, 2014  8:19PM",robr2," back in the 80's, geico did make a conscious decision to not insure anyone with a radar detector.  their reasoning was that users of radar detectors have an inclination towards speeding which is a risky behavior in the eyes of an insurer. i did a google search for the topic and there wasn't one example of it actually happening today.  lots of discussion group fodder saying that ""they heard"" or ""i had a friend whose cousin's wife's old boss..."""
"September  4, 2014  8:20PM",driver100," abacomike so it was the sales manager and/or the finance manager who really was at fault! the salesman just presents the numbers&gt;  &gt; mike, i guess i missed that part...if i am dealing with a salesperson that is the person who gets on the computer and comes up with the amount.  when i bought the mercedes-benz benz i never saw a manager, the salesman didn't leave my sight...he wrote up the deal, he gave me the discount. but, whether it was the salesman or the manager, our friend was taken advantage of.  i know he signed and is legally committed to what is on paper, but, if the dealership personnel were really fair, they would know they mislead their customer, accidentally or on purpose, and if they are decent human beings, they will modify the invoice."
"September  4, 2014  8:23PM",driver100," not necessarily.  rates could be cheap because of the volume of business they do....they get that volume because of the ads.  some companies work on no advertising low volume principle, some on lots of advertising = high volume = lower prices principle.  if no one knows about them volume will be less, prices will be higher. just a business decision."

"September  4, 2014  8:43PM",dino001," i know one thing about car insurance - stay too long and you are paying 20-30% more than others, it's guaranteed.  they see each renewal as an invitation to raise the price next time.  the only exception was progressive that kepts its rate for several years, even lowered at some point, then they woke up and hit me with two sequential 15% increases.  i took the first one, but after the second i called and the lady said it's the way it is, so i thanked them and moved away back to the old rate. the insurers generally don't care about keeping current business - it's a different department.  new business is what counts - of course they subsidize it through marketing budget, hoping you'll not move again when the honeymoon is over. another time ameriprise raised its rate by 40% with attached letter of adverse credit due to rapid increase of debt - it was just because i refinanced my house, but the old debt did not drop from the record yet at time they were drafting the renewal.  when i called them just before the actual renewal time (i got a notice two months in advance) and told check my credit now, the lady said new rate wasn't related to the credit.  really, so what was that adverse credit letter about?  i thanked them for their business and moved on with allstate, current with them.  they are creeping the rates slowly up, last time 10%, this time 5%, if they keep it up that way, within next two-three cycles i'll have to thank them and ask somebody else. it's generally not good to go from one to another too often - it will catch up with you.  however, three-four years is just the sweet spot for me. btw, everybody talks about geico being cheap - i don't know why, but not for me.  they hates me, they never gave me a best rate no matter how good my record was.  and i don't mean they missed it by two bucks, it's usually 20% or so.  i had good experience with progressive, traveler's, allstate, ameriprise.  some other companies kept rates close, but subaru mutual and geico hate me for reasons unknown.  i have no tickets, no recent claims, last claim over 5 years ago, excellent credit score - but still, they often come significantly higher than many others.  subaru is even worse - their rates are from the moon."
"September  4, 2014  9:11PM",dino001, just checked progressive - they are quoting me $200/6 months less then the renewal offer (same coverage).  time to switch...
"September  4, 2014  9:23PM",roadburner, the real story is that there is virtually no increase in loss exposure from a driver who picks up the occasional speeding ticket(i have a friend who used to serve in the ky legislature; during a hearing he asked some insurance industry reps for proof that speeding tickets increase loss exposure. two decades later he is still waiting). by making it easier to cite speeders geico was/is hoping to profit. end of story.
"September  4, 2014  9:29PM",abacomike,
"September  4, 2014  9:36PM",robr2, end of story. ...well geico is a for profit business - they can make the rules as long as they are legal.
"September  4, 2014  9:41PM",driver100," &gt; yes, i have a contract that states the value of my trade in, the cost of a current 2014 e350, with all additional charges, a notation that shows i get 4% off, whatever the price of the 2015 e400 will be.  they can calculate the value of my trade in today, and know what it will be worth by mid october. i bought the last 2 car this same way.  maybe the salesmen here have more latitude, as we are a little easier going in most manners.  i think the sales manager thing is like a barier to break you down....wastes time, and gives the dealership more excuses to try to break the customer down. i am sure the salesman would call on the sales manager here if the action got hot and heavy."

"September  4, 2014 10:11PM",houdini1, i found a 2014 article on carinsurance.com that said geico canceled a guy's insurance policy because he owned a radar detector back in 1988 in maryland. he appealed to the state insurance comm. and his policy was reinstated. same thing happened in 1989 in california. insurance also reinstated. currently no ins. co. has a question about a radar detector on their application. the article also stated that radar detectors are illegal in a couple of states (virginia &amp; d.c.) and in most of canada.
"September  4, 2014 10:30PM",isellhondas," i'm glad you are happy with geico and i'm surprised you are saving that much.  state farm covers our car and out home.  i shopped around a few years ago and, yes, i could have saved a very small amount.  nothing like the amount you stated. hopefully, you will never have a claim but if you do, i hope you don't get dropped. a friend went with one of the discount ins. companies and after getting rear ended twice in a year sitting at a stop light they dropped him.  said he was ""accident prone"" even though he did nothing but sit there."
"September  4, 2014 10:35PM",stickguy," mike so sorry to hear.  i just lost my mom last week to the big c (intestinal, so different but still insidious type).  have the memorial/internment saturday.  only hope is you catch it early, and treat aggressively.  so hopefully the treatment on your son does the job.  helps to be otherwise young and healthy, to be able to fight the beast."

"September  4, 2014 10:39PM",koctailz," i made sure the one i bought had the green hov sticker right on it. most of the dealers i dealt with around here obtained the hov stickers to put on the car on the lot. this is why in about 2 months the # of stickers jumped from 45,000 to 55,000. i expect they are almost out. dealers might play hardball with those green stickers car on their lot when the 55k is hit. there is a bill to increase to 70k, but even if it passes it won't take effect until january 1. i am going to email the sales manager to see if he is interested in meeting with me regarding this or if he doesn't reply to my email i will just drop in on him. it may do nothing, but i think it will make me feel better. i do like to call people out when they behave badly. when i was playing with the figures after the fact and looking at the money factor....i was charged something close to roughly .001 and the correct money factor is closer to .0001. i am probably way too naive...but could they have made a math error? it was late friday nite and the finance guy i signed with had only been there 2 weeks hondaing to him. i think though the figures were already pre-filled from the sales manager/finance manager before i sat down. is correct that the sales guy was basically the delivery person. he went into the finance room and would come back with info. he wasn't responsible for running any numbers."

"September  4, 2014 10:53PM",isellhondas," in our market area, there happens to be another honda dealer that also sells honda lawn mowers, generators and other related items. years ago, they had a short lived promotion where they ""gave away"" a honda lawnmower with every new honda they sold that weekend. i had recently sold a new civic to a jerk of a customer who made it a miserable process.  i was glad when he finally left with his new car! so, he sees the lawnmower ad and he calls me... "" hey, craig...i just got my survey and i'm holding it in my hand...do i get a free lawnmower?"" me /"" nothing is ever free, they just built the price of that lawnmower into the price of the car!"" "" well, i guess i'll have to give you a crappy survey...i want to talk to your gm!"" and, he did.  the only time i ever heard our gm lose his temper with anyone! and, yep i got the exact survey he promised!"
"September  4, 2014 10:53PM",stickguy," yes mike, losing a parent is sad and stressful, but something to expect.  i would never want to outlive my kids, but my philosophy is that life (god, whatever you call it) is what you get, and you just deal with it as best as possible and move on.  you really can only control how you react, not what is handed to you."
"September  4, 2014 10:59PM",venture, &gt; mike - you're the toughest guy i know. you will be ok. i feel really bad for you and wish there was something i could do for you.

"September  4, 2014 11:34PM",driver100," good move koctailz...at the very least it will be a learning experience for you and the dealer.  i always think of it as sharpenning my consumer skills and/or negotiating skills. i have got renissanls by just talking in a professional mild reasonable manner.  in all sales, particularly the car business, one customer will talk to 20 people and word does make a difference. good luck, know you will be lucky to get a renissanl - don't count on it, but better to at least discuss it and get it out of your system."
"September  4, 2014 11:38PM",driver100," i can see how you could get a negative attitude toward customers.  unfortunately, maybe only 5% of customers are like that...at most 20% in some cases.  but, those few leave a bigger impression than the decent ones. i have dealt with the public and i have dealt with businesses....and businesses are much easier. when i dealt with the public i had a saying....the customer is usually wrong!"
"September  5, 2014 12:05AM",houdini1," mike, something very similar happened in my family earlier this year. it is still too painful to really talk about here, but let's just say i completely understand how you are feeling. god bless you my friend, a lot of people are praying for you and your son. all the best."

"September  5, 2014  2:04AM",driver100," one quick example of why i don't think that is a good way to do business. we traded in our 1999 mercedes-benz benz for a 2003 mercedes-benz benz.  we didn't realize until after the deal that we still had about a year and a half left on the extended warranty and that should have been a credit for us. the paperwork was done and we didn't think of this until we went back to pick up the new car. the salesman said there wasn't anything that could be done about it now.  well, i didn't look at another mercedes-benz benz - it just turned me off, for over 11 years.  i didn't buy this car from that dealer. i know it would be impossible to change the paperwork by the time we realized our mistake.  but, a much better way for that dealer to make it up to us would be to offer that amount as a discount on our next car (and they would have had another sale, as well as a happy customer). or they could have given us service equivalent to that amount, and it would have cost them less than the full amount. why antagonize people when the dealership pulled the fast one......by accident or on purpose. too much business these days is the ""got you"" attitude.  i would prefer to work on the principle that both parties come out winners."
"September  5, 2014  2:08AM",snakeweasel," the invicta's looked like real good watches (felt well made and solid) however i really have to wonder about something they can sell lots of at deep discounts. there was another watch they had a sale on, it was a watch set where you got the watch and jewelry (for women) or a pen with either a wallet or business card holder (for men). they were labeled with a msrp of $85.00 selling for $19.95. people were buying 3, 4 and even 5 watch sets, afterwards they had several left over and were still selling them at the $19.95 price and i took a look at them. they seemed to be real cheap, they had the feel of something that came out of a cracker jack box."

"September  5, 2014  2:20AM",snakeweasel," or they are just plain out lying, some people will ""bend"" the truth to make themselves look like they are the big man on campus. it's just like the guy at the gym boasting that he can bench press twice his weight. good advice for just about anything. true, if i went around telling everyone that not only did i get that brand new bmw 7 series for nothing but that the dealer gave me $100 to boot someone will say they got the same deal only the dealership gave them $200. lets face it, ford will sell thousands of ford gt's with a certain option package priced at a certain msrp and only one person will get the best deal. the thing is just get a good deal that you are happy with and don't worry that out there there is someone who paid $100 less."
"September  5, 2014  2:30AM",snakeweasel," the thing is you are selling a functionally homogenous product, a base civic is a base civic is a base civic. once you are on the road your experience with the car isn't going to be influenced by what lot you drove off of. so while people might be loyal to a brand and that brand competes with others on many things (handling, performance, reliability, comfort and the like) the main thing dealerships compete with others selling the same brand is by price."

"September  5, 2014 11:40AM",driver100," the thing about our balance of warranty was that was extra profit the dealer was going to make anyway....to me it is almost like theft that they would keep that money and not find a way to make it up to us - the salesman should have known about the warranty - it was in our file.  the sales manager, who was the owners son, was an arrogant moron who lived a block away from us. that's a case of now that i think of it, i should have talked to him about what was done.  as you pointed out, people who lie or cheat or deceive don't care, they probably enjoy taking advantage (scr--ing) of a customer, but, i think it would have been good therapy for me to tell him why i wouldn't be buying another car from him. something else, some business people work on the principle that if they rip someone off they will be the winner - they will gain more  (that's how my sil thinks - the more he rips people off the more he will have, it works the opposite, and he spends half of his time trying to fix things and fielding complaints, and not many repeat customers).  i think of business as a cooperative project....if i can give you the customer the best value possible (good price, good service, no hassle buying etc.) then why wouldn't you come back....unless you want to change brands, which is fair enough. mike, i am glad you understand my point about the warranty, and i know talking to the manager probably won't solve this fellows problem....but, i know, i feel better letting them know what i think.  the problem with leaving it up to the survey is 1) the fellow may not get a survey 2) the dealer will say he is lying, he signed and now he is bitter...it's a he said they said and they will probably win."
"September  5, 2014  1:16PM",ab348," if a dealer offers free gym sessions, free massages, free eats, etc that tells me they are making lots of extra profits to pay for all that. i would much rather have them offer excellent, competent, courteous, quick service on my vehicle rather than all that extraneous stuff that must (imo) take away from what they are investing in their core business."

"September  5, 2014  3:27PM",stickguy," my goal is to not visit the dealer again once i drive off with the car, any more than needed, which should be when it needs an oil change.  and on the last new car, i don't even go to the dealer i got it at, and the one i use still treats me like a king."
"September  5, 2014  3:29PM",graphicguy," i remember that.  which is why, to this day, i won't be a customer of geico's.  same thing with plugging in their little ""thingamajig"" so they can track my driving habits.  not happening.  got too many red light cameras, sneaky police chrysler disguised as ordinary car hiding in thickets to try to bust me speeding. i'll do everything within my power to not only fight things like red-light cameras (rb, do you know what ever happened to the law suits stating those are unconstitutional?), sneaky speed traps and police ticket set ups. even those ""drunk driving"" commercials that they run showing police hiding, blending in with the background, waiting for you to do something wrong, remind me of a ""gestapo-esk"" totalitarian society.  i don't care what message they're trying to send.  it's not a very good one and really flies in the face of what we all believe.  it's almost like they're saying ""watch your every move, because we certainly are.""  i thought we fought wars to thwart that behavior and thinking?"

"September  5, 2014  3:53PM",ab348," my personal rule is to use the dealer for all maintenance items required excluding tires while the car is under warranty. that way hopefully the service writers get to recognize me a little and hopefully treat me better as a regular customer when i come in with a problem potentially under warranty. however after that all bets are off. this week a good friend told me the latest in his continuing tale of woe regarding his ford ranger 4x4 pickup. he ordered this to his own spec - the top-line model (xlt?) which dealers here did not bring in for stock, 5-speed manual transmission. it is a 2010 so is now out of warranty, has 42,000 miles, mostly highway. they have a country place they are rebuilding about 90 minutes away and that is what they drive when they go there. he had had all sorts of issues with this truck both in and out of warranty. he told me this week how he has spent a couple of thousand $ on it the last 2 years for brake work, which i find hard to believe. apparently the rear discs are a problem. the latest was that the clutch failed this week. for whatever reason he took it to a ford dealer and let them fix it. the cost was a cool $1800. this is with them selling him the parts at wholesale. apparently 10 hours labor. yikes."

"September  5, 2014  4:04PM",driver100," that's what i would think too, but, i don't think it works that way necessarily.  i was intimidated by the mb dealer where i bought the new ""e"".  it is probably the fanciest dealer in north america, they have about 15 car on display in pools of water.  a full coffee and sandwich shop, gym, spa, tv room, service department has cleaner floors than most homes. the deal went as smooth as could be, i couldn't have done better.  it's a case of build a good dealership, treat the customers fairly, sell a lot more car than you would have from a hole in the wall, and not only will it cover your costs, you will actually make more money.  the old, you have to spend a buck to make a buck....if done properly it can really work."
"September  5, 2014  4:18PM",driver100," &gt; sounds about the same as my friends 2004 blazer.  he bought it at the end of the line for a really cheap price....about $14k us ($16k cdn). he wants it to last for the rest of his life and it probably will....at least it has heavy metal and fairly simple.  however, lots of things breakdown like even the door hinges, they aren't strong enough considering the weight of the doors. before that he had a ford tempo that cost him more in repairs than it would have cost to buy a new car.  at least i convinced him to drop the tempo and although the blazer isn't the ultimate in car design and engineering, with some help, it could last a few decades."
"September  5, 2014  5:06PM",ab348," the place i just retired from (nslc, the provincial liquor retailer) does that too. we get people who buy a case of beer and have the case rip open as they are going through the parking lot. or they drop the bag with a bottle of whatever in it the same way. if the store staff witness it they usually just replace it. the profit margin is high enough that it is worth it for the goodwill it generates. i would much rather have a car dealership do something similar, go good for items that are somewhat questionable as to cause, instead of spending that money building a spa. i will never use the spa, but i may well appreciate them covering something on my car that i might otherwise need to pay for."
"September  5, 2014  5:33PM",oldfarmer50," for you tesla fans there was a story on tesla's new nv factory on cnbc and they mention that the factory is located in an industrial park owned by the same guy who owns the ford ranch brothel. the head of tesla said nv's quick permitting process was a major factor because they needed the factory to be ready on time. makes you wonder why they didn't just throw in with mitsubishi.  they have a plant in normal, indiana with a capacity of 250k car that is about 2/3 unused."
"September  5, 2014  5:48PM",abacomike," i think the plant is located in normal, illinois near bloominpontiacn.  my daughter graduated from illinois state university in bloominpontiacn/normal, and i remember seeing that plant there.  check it out. i just looked it up, and it is normal, illinois.  they build the new outlander there along with other models.  and yes, the plant is at 1/3 capacity. however, i don't think that plant could handle the tesla models unless they did some major overhauling of the plant.  in the end, it might be more cost effective to just build a new plant in a state where taxes are more reasonable.  california and illinois have some of the highest corporate tax rates in the country, not to mention real estate taxes.  remember, illinois is so far in debt they may never be able to handle it in the long run."
"September  5, 2014  5:57PM",abacomike," from what my research revealed to me over the past few hours is giving me some hope for my son.  he specifically requested a change in venue from the hospital and doctors in the desert to loma linda medical center near riverside, ca because he thought they knew more about treating his brain tumor. well, it would appear that loma linda specializes in proton radiation treatment and was the first medical center to offer that treatment in the country back in the early 1990's.  they are fairly well known for the proton radiation labs they have at the hospital. he is supposed to hear from the doctors and the treatment center there at the hospital today or monday for a schedule as to when he will undergo radiation treatments.  i sure hope they hurry up as we don't want this tumor to enlarge or spread. but it seems that loma linda is a preferred medical center for this proton radiation."
"September  5, 2014  6:04PM",snakeweasel,
"September  5, 2014  6:05PM",abacomike," speaking of these mega dealerships that offer all these services and perks for their customers, there is no doubt that it costs money and the bottom line of their dealerships is probably affected by these special facilities.  but, remember, all those extras are a cost of doing business and are therefore tax deductible in the eyes of state and federal taxes.  so, assume the tax rate is 35% - which means that for every dollar they spend on these perks or facilities, it only costs them 65 cents. my mercedes-benz benz dealership does not have the perks that driver's dealership has.  all they offer is free coffee and cookies.  they used to offer bagels and cream cheese, but not any more.  but they do offer free car washes, no matter how often you want them.  that alone saves me over $1000 a year.  their service department is outstanding and they offer mercedes-benz benz loaners whenever the car is in for service. but the dealership i used to work for in margate, fl (lexus) has an entire floor located above its service department which is the size of 1/2 a football field, for customers to relax, use the fitness facilities, etc.  they also offer complimentary finger foods such as sandwiches, sweet rolls, all kinds of coffee, etc.  it cost them a fortune - but they can afford it - they are the number one volume lexus dealers in the country and are owned by southeast toyota and the moran family."
"September  5, 2014  6:10PM",driver100," the case of a bottle of booze accidentally breaking is another excellent example.  we've all seen a broken bottle of something at the grocery store...and of course, staff clean it up and the customer isn't charged.  why charge $3 for a bottle of ketchup on a $400 grocery bill? the spa thing is a bit different.  i assume women hate to get a car serviced and to think that a day is wasted.  but, get nails and a massage while the car is being fixed....especially at a high end luxury car dealer......that's ingenious.  now, she will probably be volunteering to take her husbands car in for him too. ab...you won't get much out of the spa, but, a lot of women will, though you could try getting a manicure and you may like it."
"September  5, 2014  6:11PM",abacomike," i would imagine it is in conflict of one of the bill of rights - the right to pass red lights is part and parcel of the right to happiness (you know, the right to life, subaru and the pursuit of happiness). we have those red light cameras down here in broward county and, for some strange reason, the municipalities and county are not realizing the windfall of money they expected from catching these red light passers.  many have gotten attorneys who successfully get them off.  i have not done any research into this, but i would imagine it may be based on imperfections in the timing of the infraction.  but i do know that some of the municipalities have been taking these systems out of play due to the cost overruns."

"September  5, 2014  8:54PM",roadburner,"  the red light cameras have never been ruled unconstitutional, but the penalties tend to be defined by the local government as ""administrative"" not criminal, which is a way to make an end run around any constitutional safeguards. like speed cameras they are in essence nothing more than a revenue stream and has little to no effect on traffic safety."
"September  5, 2014  9:05PM",imidazol97," in ohio, the previous governor leaving had a bill in front of him that he vetoed, calling it a ""gift to the townships and cities"" to paraphrase. he meant he was leaving them a way to generate income. of course some of those cities cited safety as the big reason for the cameras. however, there still are people running red lights, so i fail to see how they have made things safer. the cities cite that at those intersections the number of red light accidents went down. of course at other intersections, not so much, since the locals know which ones have cameras and which don't. then recently bills went through the legislature and the same cities citing ""safety"" as the big cause for the money-making cameras complained that they were going to lose money and it would mean real problem for their local taxpayers to lose that income. the senate of ohio is still holding up the bill, hoping i suspect that a couple of court cases working their way to the highest court will take the pressure off them to kill the red light/speed cameras against the wishes of their lobbyist friends. so which is it money or safety? further, as i understand, the catch to outlawing them was that ohio is ""home rule."" so the cameras weren't gong to be outlawed but rather a real policeman had to be present as each camera was snapping pictures of hundred dollar bills. that requirement meant most cameras would not be useable with no policeman for the violator to face as his accuser."
"September  5, 2014  9:06PM",driver100," in tampa they were going to get rid of red light cameras.  mainly because they seem to just be a way to increase revenue, and they may be causing more accidents than they prevent as people jam on their brakes trying to stop.."

"September  6, 2014 12:25AM",venture," my subscription that came with the new fusion recently expired. i called siriusxm and said i would renew if they offered me a better rate. like you, i usually only listen to one channel. they offered me $89 a year plus the ""royalty fee"". anywho - it came to just over $100. of course the lady wanted a credit card to bill it to. i said i would only pay an invoice with a check so they couldn't automatically renew me at the full rate next year. she then said about the $2 fee to send an invoice. i refused to pay the $2 since they already sent me 3 letters asking me to renew the subscription. she waived that fee. i do use a usb stick for music and occasionally my phone, but it's just easier to listen to sirius. oddly enough, i did the opposite of you. i renewed the radio, but dropped the traffic and weather alerts. it was cool to just say, ""weather map"" and have it pop up on the nav screen, but i can see radar on my phone. in my area there are very few roads (if any) that they cover as far as grid-lock or accident occurrences so i didn't need that. and i don't really care where the cheapest gas is."

"September  6, 2014 12:48AM",oldfarmer50," unfortunately, much of law and regulatory enforcement has become a revenue source for government too cowardly to raise taxes officially or cut services to favored constituents. in the city i grew up in there was a little mom &amp; pop pharmacy that threw away a box of medicaid receipts after 5 years instead of 6 which the state required. instead of fining them for the one error the state fined them $500 for each piece of paper in the box--a total of $2.8 million. in an interview state health department officials admitted they were tasked with ""generating revenue"" from such errors. makes a mockery of the cop hiding in the bushes for ""safety""."

"September  6, 2014  3:23PM",driver100," basically, i agree with you fushi but i don't want to give up sirius over that one issue.  i mark on several calendars my renewal date and i make sure i call them before that date comes up.  i note the time of the call and ask who i am speaking to.  if i decide to cancel i will do the same. they are pretty good about it when i call, even though it is a few weeks before the deadline. they give me a credit and start charging on my new plan. i tried asking if i could send a check but they obviously don't want that...i am sure they get lots of renewals just because people forget."
"September  6, 2014  3:28PM",driver100," speaking about ""forgetting"" and tim hortons.  i have a tim hortons card, i usually buy $20 on it and it makes it easier to swipe my card.  not sure if you do that in the us. it is a great money maker for tim's, they are sitting on all this cash that they can collect interest on.  also, one tends to spend more since it isn't the same as handing over actual cash. the other way they win is like this.  i had about $8 left on my card, went through the drive-thru, guy handed me a coffee, somehow he didn't hand me back my card.  i am out $7! as verdugo would say....caveat emptor or whatever."

"September  6, 2014  5:56PM",driver100," you are right, i should have gone back.  and, normally i would, as a matter of principle.  but, it was 2 days later when i realized i was missing my card (but, i know that was the last place i used it and i recall i didn't get it back).  the thing is, do i drive over and spend time trying to convince the manager about my story? i needed a battery for my wife's car lock remote. bought one at target (now in canada and not doing very well), for $5 and it didn't work.  stopped at a hardware store, got 2 for $6.99.  just not worth my while to go thru the whole hassle of trying to return a $5 battery.  i am not sure they would believe me because what's to stop someone from putting an old battery in the package and trying to return that?  i saved $3 on the 2 batteries, so i was only out $2...but, then again they sell 3 batteries for $1 at the dollar store, but they had closed (i could have made money on that deal)."

"September  6, 2014  7:34PM",driver100," 20 years ago i got a speeding ticket, caught on photo radar!  i was on the entrance dodgep trying to get on the highway.  one lane was closed for repairs, the right lane.  there were huge trucks coming at full speed in the other two lanes.  i just gunned it to get thru the construction zone in the first lane, and to get ahead of the 2 trucks.  and i got caught...$65. the photo radar has no capacity to think or reason, at least a cop wouldn't be so stupid as to be sitting next to a highway near an entrance dodgep when there is construction going on. since then a new provincial government axed photo radar, and it hasn't come back....hmm, that was the one and only time we had a socialist new democratic party.....without getting into any debates that might mean something.

"September  6, 2014 10:53PM",koctailz, just wanted to post the follow up to my dealings with the dealer that charged me an inflated money factor on my lease. i emailed the sales manager of the dealer responding to his post purchase email asking if i was pleased with my purchase. i told him i was not and would like to meet with him to discuss the details. we met in his office and he had another sales manager and finance manager there as well. i was a bit surprised by this. i told him what happened and the finance manager basically says they have a spread on the money factor they can use and the sales manager tells me they like to focus on the monthly payment versus these details. anyway i told him my interaction with the sales guy that i specifically asked him if  i had qualified for the best lease rate after running my credit. he said yes. he agreed that the salesman was wrong in saying this. so he asks me what i would like them to do about it. i told him i would like them to re-do the lease with the correct .25 money factor. finance manager said that was impossible as it was already with ford credit. i then asked him if they would write me a check for the difference of the money factor i was charged... $1500. he said absolutely to my shock. they detailed my car and handed me the check. i think the other 2 employees were also in shock. very pleased and stunned with this outcome.

"September  7, 2014 12:05PM",driver100," i don't think they should be dinged on the survey.  it could have been a mistake, it could have been done on purpose.  the thing is the dealer corrected the problem when it was pointed out.  anything can go wrong in a transaction....if the problem is fixed everything is good, koctailz is a happy customer, and he should not mention the problem. you can't blame the dealer for trying, he should have double checked, but, when the error was pointed out they came through right away....they deserve an excellent rating and should be rewarded for listenning to the customer - remember, they didn't have to do that."

"September  7, 2014  3:06PM",houdini1," speaking of sitting low in a car and not being able to see out reminds me of an early '70,s ford gran torino that i had as a company car. you literally sat on the floor in that thing. i am 6-1 and i had to look thru the steering wheel. my boss, at the time, was an older gentleman about 5-2 and he could hardly see out the side windows. the padding in the front seat was about an inch thick if that, and if you hit a bump your butt would hit the floor. if the gas gauge got anywhere near empty you were out of gas. period. it was also a sickly green color...but i drove that thing about 75,000 miles over 2 years and it never missed a beat, plus i was 30 years old, had an expense acct., a company car, and life was pretty good !!"

"September  7, 2014  3:49PM",abacomike," driver, i thought you ordered diamond silver metallic, not white, for your e400?  i guess you must have changed your mind."
"September  7, 2014  4:08PM",snakeweasel," again the accuser is the city/county/state which is represented by their attorneys. the pictures or video have to be reviewed by someone using specific metrics and they can be called into court. now i have to ask, if you were on a jury in a murder case and the evidence against the defendant was that his fingerprints and dna were all over the crime scene, the victims blood was all over his clothes and there was a very clear video from a security camera showing the defendant killing the victim you wouldn't convict because no ""warm body"" testified to the act?"
"September  7, 2014  4:09PM",driver100," i taught high school driving classes in one of those 70s torinos.  the rear window sloped a lot too, so there was a lot of hidden spots.  i felt i was driving in a pit too.  i preferred teaching in the plymouth valiant, very squared off with big windows.  the perfect car for driver ed btw....i know all about expense accounts.  after 16 years with the same company, and a company car, and i got canned from that job, it was very hard to start paying for my own gas, car insurance, and car.  i had to grow up quickly and get used to the real world."
"September  7, 2014  4:11PM",driver100," remember, i saw a white one coming at me and i liked the white better than diamond silver (just by a little bit).  i went back to the dealer and they changed it for me, the last day before the color would have been locked in."
"September  7, 2014  4:19PM",snakeweasel," $600 for a years worth of gas? either you have a car that gets super high mpg or you don't drive very much or you're living in the 60's. at todays prices around here and doing my normal driving i would go about 3,700 miles or roughly 3.5 months on $600."

"September  7, 2014  5:28PM",houdini1," i also tend to like white colors for autos, especially metallic white. plain white, not so much. it also depends on the particular car. some look great in white, some look like delivery vehicles."
"September  7, 2014  5:41PM",driver100," it seems that way.  my current car is white, but actually the car before that was james bond blue, the 2004 x3 before that white.  my wife has had white for 2 car in a row and the volkswagen is white. i don't get as tired of white as quickly as i do other colors.  i also like black but my wife said if i got black i would have to wash it every day.  thus white!"
"September  7, 2014  6:02PM",roadburner, that is a flawed analogy; in the murder scenario there are multiple items as well as differing types of evidence. would you convict someone of a crime solely on the basis of <strong>  one </strong> fingerprint or photo? and would it trouble you to know that the individuals collecting the evidence worked on commission based on how much evidence was collected?

"September  7, 2014  7:52PM",oldfarmer50," wasn't that the first year of the much maligned fox body? that style isn't my cup of tea but it's not ugly either. that era had some pretty bad styling as car makers spent all their money trying to build lighter, gas sipping vehicles.  i remember when they came out with the miniature dodge dodge in the 80s i thought my car buying days were over."

"September  7, 2014  8:54PM",verdugo, must be strong and stick to my new year's resolution. deep breaths.
"September  7, 2014  9:22PM",roadburner," it depends on the jurisdiction; in states/municipalities where traffic citations are codified as ""administrative offenses"" constitutional safeguards do not apply. the iihs, speed/red light camera businesses, etc., <strong>  love </strong> those jurisdictions as it's much easier to keep the money flowing to the various ""interested parties"". and since the camera companies get compensated by the number of citations issued, it's much easier to scam the public in these jurisdictions by shortening yellow lights , etc, in states like kentucky, <strong>  any </strong> moving violation is a criminal offense and all of the constitutional rights must be granted to the accused- proof beyond a reasonable doubt, a trial by jury, the right to confront your accuser, the right subpoena witnesses/produce evidence, etc. the photo taxation companies have lobbied the ky legislature to make it possible for them to set up their money machines in the bluegrass state, but they have had no success- thankfully."
"September  7, 2014  9:49PM",js06gv," my first car in 1986 was a '74 gran torino 4-door in a lime yellow-green color with a dark green vinyl interior. i just got a laugh out of your description of the seat and driving position as it was spot on. i remember being able to feel the seat springs on every bump too. and standard seating adjustments were pitiful back in those days too. just back and forth with no recline or anything else.  a tank of a first car, with less than 10 mpg out of the 351 cleveland engine (that was good for, what, a whopping 140 hp back in the day?). fortunately, gas in houston in the late '80s was still well under a buck a gallon."

"September  8, 2014  3:12AM",stickguy," it doesn't really bother me to change stations.  either because a song i don't like comes on, or i just feel like changing the mood.  just flick the thumb on the button, and scroll through.  generally of the 6 xm1 presets is working for me, or i can get radical and punch up xm2."

"September  8, 2014  2:32PM",roadburner," and neither does the burden of proof;  in the photo radar case you want to convict on the basis of one item of evidence- in the murder case there are multiple different items of evidence- all of which corroborate each other. again, would you convict someone of murder based on one fingerprint? at least you could cross examine the person who collected the evidence, as well as the person who analyzed it. in a traffic photo case you'd have one guy who basically testifies, ""i downloaded the picture and the camera says the defendant is guilty- and oh yeah, the camera also told me it was working fine."" fortunately, it's a moot point where i live, as well as in any state where the people have the good sense to keep constitutional protections in place for any criminal infraction. and i feel sorry for the residents of states where the bureaucrats who run their traffic offense money collection scheme believe that the book <em>  1984 </em> had a happy ending..."

"September  8, 2014  2:52PM",imidazol97," in ohio the earlier attempt to ""outlaw"" the monster companies from australia, e.g., that run these things failed due to the governor's veto at end of his term. but more recently elmwood place, suburb of cincinnati had them frozen and that court case may be still in the ohio courts and one that the senate is counting on to do the senate's job since they're afraid to cross the donors vs their constituents wishes. my state representative said his opposition was due to the lack of ability to challenge the tickets the way it's set up here. i believe toledo also has a case in the higher courts. i put the red light camera/speed camera companies on the same level as the policemen back in the 70s and 80s that ""retired"" with high retirements, started their own company doing investigations where they would put their workers into schools to try to find out who was selling the drugs. the operation mode was essentially an entrapment setup to catch the other high school kids. i don't understand why the ohio senate doesn't just bring the bill out of committee and vote so the people will know how each one stands. worse is the lying cities who claim it's for safety on tv and radio interviews then as soon as the money may dry up the reality that they need the money to continue their highly overpaid public servant status as officers and other public officials rather than for the public safety. i still see red light accidents happening. and they said the cameras would stop all that. i still see speeding on the same streets/highways where they put up the speed cameras too. they said the cameras would stop all that."

"September  8, 2014  2:59PM",imidazol97," i personally would think a fox listener is more open minded toward hearing both sides of a story instead of just one side as other alphabet networks' listeners are. my last call of duty was really hard to get dismissed. i was 2nd from being an alternate and i had to work at getting off. i was ready to ask to be heard quietly at the bench because i was going to have to tell them that after watching the behavior or the criminal during the morning's proceedings and part of the afternoon during jury questioning, my analysis of his body language and eye movements was that he was guilty and he considered himself to be one of the criminal sharpies who could lie and maneuver  his way out of anything--much like the cohort in the ferguson shooting trying to lie on the first tv interviews and polluting the other alleged witnesses--except this defendant had an intelligence in the 130's i would estimate."
"September  8, 2014  3:11PM",roadburner," funny thing, no jurisdiction that uses these so-called ""safety cameras"" classify speeding or disregarding a traffic control device as a criminal offense. they have to be classified as civil infractions in order for the cameras to survive. moving violations are reclassified as being equivalent to parking tickets- otherwise the companies and municipalities couldn't get away with it. of course insurance companies don't raise your premiums for parking tickets... and even then, the constitutionality of many of their revenue enhancement schemes has been successfully challenged, such as in - where cleveland tried to cut the court system out altogether."

"September  8, 2014  4:10PM",ab348," this could describe me as well. i have a neighbor at the back of my property who is a really odd duck, and scary. a single guy who has lived there for 20 years or more, now retired from a blue-collar railway job. when i first moved here i tried to introduce myself to him early on and got blown off. i was astounded, we were perhaps 10 feet apart i am there saying ""hello!"" 3 times and he just ignores me entirely while looking straight at me. a couple of years later he was standing in my driveway looking up. i went out to introduce myself and his first words were a threat to sue me if i didn't have a tree at the rear of the property taken out, without any prior discussion on the topic. then one day i saw a guy in my driveway digging post holes on the property line, turned out he was employed by this clown to build a fence but hadn't told him he hadn't talked to anyone first. he then planted hedges entirely around his property and has not ever trimmed them, so they are now 12-14 feet tall and act as an impenetrable barrier. what else -- oh yeah, one day before the hedges took over i was in the spare bedroom on my elliptical machine which faced the window that looks toward his property. he came around the corner from his driveway, saw me in the window, and gave me the finger. i just about fell off the machine. i asked my 89 y-o neighbor about him, a sweet british lady, and she said she tried to introduce herself to him when he first moved in and he blew her off as well. he never has any visitors or friends come by, not a surprise. this guy apparently does not cook or ever buy groceries from what i can tell since he leaves and returns with fast food 3 times a day, morning noon and night. he has a gun that he uses to fire at critters (blanks i hope) in his backyard to keep them away. i have seen him throw snowballs in the winter at the pigeons on his roof. and whatever windblown debris (candy wrappers, etc) that ends up on his lawn, he picks up and throws it into neighbors property when he mows. i think he is a total lunatic and sociopath, but what can you do? he is scary enough that i would just as soon avoid him entirely, but his actions make it unpleasant."

"September  8, 2014  6:46PM",imidazol97," but, just ignore your neighbor, he is obviosly anti-social and doesn't want to be friendly. i think there's something wrong with the neighbor. we have zoning laws limiting hedges, fences, etc., to reasonable amounts and heights. we chose to live within a city and have neighbors. the ones in back put dirt along their rear fence line blocking the water that used to leave my property onto theirs and then run onto their neighbor before making its way to the county drain on my next adjacent neighbor's property. that water backed up onto my property during really heavy rains due to their change. i never spoke to them after that. we live 1 minute from the fire department rescue location--1 minute total response time that is. the police chief lives 1/4 mile away. the past asst. fire chief lives down the street a few houses. he's now a chief for an adjacent fire agency preparing to return when the current chief retires. has a fully equipped emergency vehicle with which he responds to the neighboring agency's calls. neighbors across the road are a fireman with emergency training and his wife is a nurse. next door neighbor is a nurse. i like having neighbors. and i totally see that many people prefer not to have anyone close enough that they would be aware of them."

"September  8, 2014  8:28PM",graphicguy," driver...that valiant brought back memories.  last year of college, i needed some credit hours.  had all my major courses out of the way and needed some electives. on a whim, i took a couple of driver's education courses because a girl i had the ""hots"" for at the time was a ta for the driver's ed prof. the university had a valiant, with a ton of miles on it, with the separate brake pedal on the right for the instructor. after two quarters of driver's ed (and striking out with the ta both quarters), i got my certification by the state to teach driver's ed.  made some pretty decent money doing so (at least for a dirt poor college student at the time).  of course, i got to use the university's driver's ed car if the driver's ed student was enrolled in the university.  so, i had zero overhead, too. pretty good gig.  never used that little melange of my education again, and let my certification lapse a long, long time ago."

"September  8, 2014  8:39PM",imidazol97, that would be really irritating for me. i'd tend to just throw it back.... but if he's scary enough have you checked to see if he has a record of mental issues? arrests?  whatever the hippa laws allow?
"September  8, 2014  8:51PM",driver100," also a case of a neighbor who just isn't considerate of other people...it seems to be pretty common these days. i do wonder though if your neighbor realizes their dirt is causing flooding for you.  it may be worth devising a plan that could work for you, and then going over and having a friendly chat about the problem.  if they are like my neighbor, he couldn't care less, but, i think most people would see your predicament and try to help. i am not sure, but there may be city rules that wouldn't allow someone to redirect the flow of water onto someone elses property. we have about 20 really nice neighbors, just this one jerk next to us and when i see him i think of that saying, big fences make good neighbors.......good luck. one other thought, make a larger wall so the water goes back in his direction."
"September  8, 2014  9:05PM",driver100," i had to look up ""gaslighting someone"", never heard the term before.  this is what i found to manipulate events and situations in order to make a person believe that he or she is crazy. from the 1944 movie with charles boyer and ingrid bergman. he kept stealing her keys and putting them in the freezer in order to gaslight her. we had a neighbor across the street from us 2 houses ago.  he had a nice house which he maintained and he had nice neighbors until a new one moved in.  the two teenage sons were completely wild, had pool parties, and through their empty beer bottle/cans across onto my nice neighbors yard.  one day he saw them and through them back and the new neighbor came yelling at him and told him he better not do that. the nice neighbor didn't want it to escalate, so he just thru the bottles out himself.  eventually the kids went off to university.  the wildman had to downsize because his rug cleaning business went downhill and he moved....the whole street was happy. not sure what you can do to your neighbor...these days people have security cameras too...that's all you need!  i have thought of throwing a whole box full of laundry detergent into my neighbors pool and watching the bubbles.  i have thought of growing some trees with long roots that will go through the pool wall.  i wanted to build a 15 foot wooden fence between us, and paint his side yellow and purple.  i also wanted to wait until he had guests, go out on my deck in a tiny speedo, and dance to some loud rap music. maybe we can all help each other with a big party at each others houses."
"September  8, 2014  9:08PM",driver100," i got pretty good at using that brake on the right side, but, i was really good at reaching across and steering the car with my left hand a few times.  i'm glad i don't do driver ed any more. but one fellow at the time opened his own driver ed school and he franchised the business and he did very well.  even back then, i taught in a valiant, he taught in a firebird."

"September  9, 2014  3:50AM",nyccarguy," yup.  i'm buying this time around.  thanks for the well wishes!!  i'm planning on financing for 72 months.  subaru is offering 2.9%.  i told the sales guy that if he can get me a better rate, than ill take it from another bank. i heard an industry term when i was walking the lot with my sales guy.  a girl pulled up in her grandfather's lease return.  a previous generation impreza with a missing wheel cover &amp; numerous dings, dents, &amp; scratches.  my sales guy   ""wow!  that car has hit everything except the lotto."""
"September  9, 2014  4:17AM",mako1a, good on the buying. i ordered once and it was a fun way to buy. the dealer calls you every week or so and gives you a progress report which puts some excitement into the whole process. kind of like a countdown to delivery day. then he spins you up a little with how happy you'll be. nice.
"September  9, 2014 11:12AM",driver100," congratulations and happy driving nyc.  it isn't fair, you get your car in a week and mike and i have to wait two months. funny that all those selling prices are so close...within $26, but that ""conveyance fee"" sure makes a difference.  i guess a ""conveyance fee"" is a fancier and more expensive word for doc fee.  like a ""sales consultant"" instead of salesperson.  or a ""previously owned"" car instead of a used car. anyway, the subie sounds like a lot of fun and you are going to enjoy it!"
"September  9, 2014 11:17AM",driver100," when i leased my car around 1980 terms were generous, lots of miles, low residuals, no hassle return.  today, i understand they go over the car carefully and deduct for anything that isn't perfect.  that is probably a big advantage to buying...there is more control over those expenses, and if someone gets into financial trouble, you own the car so you can sell it.  getting out of a lease isn't easy and it could be costly."
"September  9, 2014  1:04PM",ab348," when i leased my buick they were selling some sort of ""walk away"" insurance that got you off the hook for all those little dings and scratches. i forget how much but iirc it was pretty cheap."
"September  9, 2014  1:05PM",dino001," congrats.  subaru is a great choice.  it will surely be different than that 328xi, but they deliver on what they promise - safe and inexpensive transportation with a little dose of entertainment.  here in florida, subaru dealers rank generally above the mainstream in terms of experience.  they are not quite luxury experience (long shot from it) and they don't pretend to be, but all they tend to me much more laid back and straightforward than say volume toyota/honda dealers.  after having two of those (subaru and sti) it's hard to even want to go to those other guys for a test drive.  a visit on subaru lot is always pleasant, whereas nearly every time i went to those volume stores, i felt i needed a shower afterwards."
"September  9, 2014  1:53PM",driver100," i would probably opt for that insurance if cheap enough, but i sure saved a bundle by not buying all the extra insurance i could have bought for the 535.  run flat tire insurance, $1800 - they'll replace as many as you need but for $400 you can buy a lot of tires.  also, ding insurance cost $300 or $400.  i do have one stone chip that went right through the 3m plastic shield which cost $400 and is of dubious help. insurance can be the biggest scam of this decade. they talked about a scam people are being taken for, on the radio this morning.  you get a message on your telephone that says it is very important information and you should call a number immediately.  once you call they have a recorded message that keeps you on the phone as long as possible, and you can be billed for as much as $2400 a minute.  the toll free number is in the dominican republic and can start with 809, though there are others. don't call back if you get a message and it sounds like a weird exchange number."

"September 10, 2014 12:37PM",stever," we've really been spoiled with the vans. this last trip was a pain because there was no room inside for the bikes, what with all the stuff we moved in the van. so the bikes got tied to the roof rack and never came off. i think the trick with a soul or other hatch will be a hitch rack. we don't tote canoes any more so we can otherwise downsize. the panododgeic roofs look nice but we mostly want the light up front where we sit. the ford we looked at had a nice sized sunroof but it started so far back from the windshield you couldn't really enjoy it unless you were in the backseat. (that razor looks fine but shipping kills it)."
"September 10, 2014 12:59PM",cdnpinhead," having lived in the hellhole that is phoenix for well over three decades, i've learned a few things about window tinting.  my most recent tint was expensive, but far superior to anything i've had previously.  it's called huber optik and originated in germany.  it's not nearly so dark as conventional tints but is every bit as effective."

"September 10, 2014  1:47PM",driver100," that's the kind of thing i get upset about in a car.....when it is designed poorly.  why have a sunroof if it is behind you?  then there are car with low seat and high beltlines you can't see out of.  or big pillars blocking off the view.  i am not sure how this happens, i think it is a combination of car built by committees (the engineers don't talk to the designers), restrictions on cost, manufacturers not really caring enough. that sunroof being behind the driver and passenger should not happen."

"September 10, 2014  5:57PM",driver100," i'd like to answer but i can only try.  there is no information on line and the packages changed from the 2014 to the 2015 models.  the only options i added were the sport/wood steering wheel with the flat bottom, always wanted one of those.  and the premium package i which i believe includes, sunroof, lane tracking and blind spot monitors, and i think keyless drive and pushbutton trunk are part of that package (they just have a sheet at the dealers, i suppose i could have got a copy).  i got the sport model and they said 90% of the car are ordered that way.  i took the 17 inch standard wheels because if i remember correctly, the 18 inch wheels would not have all season tires.  mine will be 4matic and i believe that is the only way you can order them here. those options are locked in, but they don't have a price list yet so i don't know the final cost, but my discount is 4% of whatever it comes out to. i didn't get full leds because i do very little driving at night, and there are few times when i used the ventilated seat so i didn't get them....i have used them less than 10x in 3 years.  i have them in the 535 and i don't like the sound of the fan going, makes me think i have left a window open. if i really like the e400 i'll get them on my next one...it will be something to look forward to.  don't forget, i'll be paying 20% more for this car in canada, and probably 30% more after all your fancy discounts. dark ashwood trim and metallic paint are now no charge.  they always used to charge $700 or $800 for metalic paint which made me laugh because they don't charge extra for car that cost a lot less????? i saw a white e350 with black spoke type wheels and i don't get that look"

"September 25, 2014 11:21PM",abacomike," the way the survey was designed, it separates those drivers who think specific safety features that are ""nice to have"" and those that are ""definitely essential"" based on whether you would pay for the technology and, if so, how much would you pay. i would think the results would/could assist manufacturers in planning what features should be offered and whether or not the feature should be standard or optional. mercedes-benz benz made an optional safety feature from previous years a standard feature for 2015 on all their car - collision avoidance braking.  if the sensors/computer identify a possible collision scenario, if after the alarm indicators are sounded the brakes have not been applied, the computer applies the brakes with proportionate energy in order to avoid the collision - front if going forward, rear if going backward.  it is separate from their distronic plus system as it is not associated with cruise control."

"October 28, 2014  7:34PM",abacomike," got a call this afternoon from mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz in montvale, nj.  i was asked if my concerns were handled appropriately by the dealership.  i responded that i was given a 2015 e350 to drive until my new car arrives from germany.  also, that a car was ordered with identical options as the first one, but that to ensure there will be no production mishaps with lane tracking and blind spot monitors, the driver assistance package was added at no additional cost to me.  further that i received a buyer's order, signed by the dealership, showing that the new car has been paid for and that the trade-in was received, showing a balance of about $3000 which the buyer (me) will not be liable for. i asked the mercedes-benz benz rep if there was any way this car could be further expedited for manufacture.  the response was that the regional mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz msnager would get involved with germany to see if there was anything that could be done to get the new car produced now rather than having to wait the 2 weeks, as scheduled for production.  they would contact me with an update as soon as they had more information. so, i guess they are bending over backwards to resolve this. my main concern is auto insurance.  since i don't actually own a car right now, geico said i have a 30 day grace period, after which they would be forced to cancel my insurance.  i shared that with montvale, nj, and they are aware of the problem.  my dealership gm said if it came to that (cancellation of my policy), they would solve that problem at the dealership level. anyone have any ideas about what options i have or what i could do to avoid this cancellation issue?"

"October 29, 2014  3:44AM",abacomike," fmc, gm, chrysler, mercedes-benz benz, etc., will advertise a 1.99% or 2.99% interest rate for highly qualified buyers.  in reality, the buy rate is at least 1% lower than the advertised rate.  i am sure of this since my experience in the car business has given me this insight after seeing it firsthand for many years. let's say a buyer takes out a 60 month loan of $20,000 at 2.49%.  the dealership earns 1%.  that is $1000 back-end profit.  often, more will be borrowed or the dealer bumps the rate another 1/2 percent. as for the salesperson explaining it?  that rarely happens.  it's the withholding of information or downright ""lying"" that angers me about the typical run-of-the-mill dealership. i have been quite lucky to have found a dealership that levels with me on every aspect of buying a car.  i am informed of the net buy rate of money if i want to finance, the net vehicle cost, actual wholesale values of trades (which they always add 1,000 - 2,000 dollars), and am kept in the loop rather than out of the loop. but your friend's experiences are not uncommon in this business.  dealership management will do everything it can to make as big a profit as possible even if it means lying through their teeth. i don't understand how buyers can go into a dealership thinking that everything is on the up and up, that's why i like edmunds.  at least you can go into a dealership with enough ammunition to walk out with a reasonably good deal on a new car."

"October 29, 2014  8:27PM",abacomike," what i believe is necessary is for gm to make cadillac dealerships solely cadillac and rid itself of dealerships that sell chevrolet, buick, cadillac and gmc.  the only exception should be in towns and villages with low population thresholds which would make combined division dealerships practical. another approach could require separate showroom buildings for each division.  this is the only way i can foresee cadillac becoming more elite and exceptional - kind of like mercedes-benz benz, bmw, etc.  when a customer brings his/her car to service, it should be exclusively cadillac and not a romper room for chevrolets, chevrolets, veranos, buick, cts, cadillac, etc. the cadillac is truly a great aotomobile once again and is becoming more and more desirable among the $50,000 - $75,000 automobile populous strata.  i would definitely consider the cadillac for my next car assuming cadillac continues their movement toward outstanding styling, quality, performance, handling and quality control. as for the numbers of dealers, i don't know how these should be distributed around the country.  here in southeat florida, within a 50 mile radius of where i live, there are 8 mercedes-benz benz dealerships, 6 of which are owned by autonation.  if you expand that distance to 75 miles, there are a total of 11.  for bmw, there are only 6 within 75 miles.  for audi, there are only 5.  cadillac has 18 dealerships - significantly more than the other luxury dealerships with most being stand-alone."
