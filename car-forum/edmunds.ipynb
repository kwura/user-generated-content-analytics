 i\\'m almost famous....... thanks...... wow, that\\'s a throwback to the old, old, old board software (well engaged? i forget its name) where you had to do this all the time to keep a discussion going after a certain number of posts. the more things change... agreed. it is very dumb and complex at the same time. we don\\'t even have a page number yet. talk about new! well, you may be almost famous.  but are you a golden god, tiny dancer? having been through the archives just a few months ago, i saw all the discussions \\'blah blah blah #6\\' and \\'blah blah blah #7\\', where post #1 was a canned statement from the (then) host about this being a continuation. iirc, the limit then was pretty small (1000 posts?). at least with 100k posts before we have to close it down it will take some time. if we average 25 posts a day, that\\'s about 9000 a year - would take 11 years to get to 100k posts again. c\\'mon, people, i\\'m sure we can average more than 25 a day. anyone have an actual story about buying or selling a car? minnie pearl \"i\\'m just so proud to be here\" !!  probably not many will remember that one. at least i got on the first page. we were discussing what is the real invoice number. i believe the invoice numbers have been raised such as those shown in edmunds to fool the purchaser. it\\'s my feeling profit margin at least double that indicated by the reported invoice. i operated on that basis negotiating my malibu purchase. ld....got the reference!!!!! i bought one and sold two in the last 3 weeks. one sold with a sign on it and the other one went to a craigslist responder an hour out of town. the used van we bought came from a dealer 20 minutes away after we did a three day road trip down to wisconsin and test drove eight or so new cars down there, and tested another 4 or 5 vans within an hour of home. i almost lost the local sale of my \\'97 outback. the buyer saw the sign, drove the car and went home and raided his strongbox, all within an hour. then i screwed up the title and had to wait until the next morning to talk to dmv (the joys of a small town, no line and the woman fixed it in 2 minutes). meanwhile the buyer was having a little remorse and thought he heard a wheel bearing noise. so i knocked $100 off and since then i\\'ve seen him cruising around a lot. he claimed he was going to check it out and then give it to his daughter, but the way he had shined it up, i bet he keeps it for himself. it was a great winter ride. the van \"sold\" sight unseen and while i was waiting for the buyer to drive the hour to my house to pick it up, i could have sold it to a local guy that was sort of a distant relation. that after it had been on craigslist a week and on the street with a sign on it for several days with zero interest. go figure. not yet.  but, i could retell my fabulous jos a. bank story! if only i had cashed in my 401k/ira prior to the greenwich concours... not a sales story, but a sales question(s)/observation.  it\\'s no secret that my two favorite brands of cars are acura and bmw (not neccessarily in that order)..  bmw\\'s are fair in retaining their value, hurt by the fact that bmw coroporate offers sizeable subsidies on their value to make the leases more attrative.  yet, they still sell for a premium on the used market. another one, acura, is known as being the brand that has one of the best resale values among all brands, have been discounting their cars, as in the case with the new rlx, over $10k off msrp.  so, the question here is, even though the previous rl was also heavily discounted, the resale value doesn\\'t \"appear\" to be affected. am i missing a piece of the puzzle here? it was 500 posts, so that\\'s quite a few less than 100k.  it took us more than 8 years to get to 100k. well, i am the first person to post from london england. that joseph el banks story is going to get lost in  the archives. i may be the first person to post here using a galaxy tab10. all i can repo r t is there are lots of mercedes here....about 15x as many as bmw! i think it\\'s been that way for a long time, though it may be getting worse.   for instance, bmws don\\'t have \"holdback\", but it\\'s common knowledge that there is 5% of invoice of back-end money that bmw pays the dealer (which varies by csi scores and volume).. and, some makes have such thin margins between msrp and invoice, that there has to be more money on the back end (volvo comes to mind). i received a letter addressed to the previous owners of our home. it\\'s from a company wanting to reunited them with their unclaimed funds from somewhere in exchange for 20% of the unstated amount. or they want to find their heirs for the same commission goal. i looked up the folks who used to live here and i find a mortgage company in florida and a sears amount in tx for more than $100 out of the states participating in the treasure hunt unclaimed funds page. none here in ohio for the folks. is it likely that\\'s what the company is wanting to get 20% of? --something related to the mortgage? either insurance refund or a settlement from the large mortgage company? i hope i can find the folks to forward this information that there may be missing money owed to them. speaking of missing money, recently someone that works with my wife said she saw out name on the nj missing funds list.  apparently there is a website where you can search by name to see what comes up.  she must have had some, so looked for other people she knew. and out name popped up. was obviously us, because the address was a bastardized mix of 1/2 our current, and 1/2 our last one.  and the date was in 1997, right around when we moved.  so, i filled out the couple of online question, and a few weeks later we got a legal looking form from the state.  filled that out, and got it notarized, and sent it back.  and yup, in a few weeks, a check showed up. i never did figure out what it was from (obviously related to the house closing), but it would have been exceptionally easy for whoever had the money to find us, if they ever bothered to look. instead, nj used our money interest free for a decade! and i almost had a shopping story today.  had to take my daughter over to the mall late in the afternoon to get a graduation dress (for her, not me!)  and we planned to stop at the volvo dealer, alas, it got too late, and the traffic at rush hour is nasty over that way, so we will have to do it some other time. is a group of several states that share their information on unclaimed funds. otherwise, check each state in which you lived or did business for unclaimed funds. the last 2 cars i sold myself, i wasn\\'t actually actively selling. in 2003 my fleet consisted of a \\'78 olds delta 88 4-door, a \\'79 buick electra 225 park avenue, and my \\'68 cutlass. yes, in 2003. i\\'ll leave the cutlass out of this as it is a hobby car. for years when i lived and worked downtown, it was the only car i had. i walked most everywhere i needed to go. when i bought a house away from downtown in 1997, i needed a beater, and wanted a rear-drive car, preferably an olds since i was familiar with the engine. the \\'78 delta i found had a rocket 350, was in reasonable shape, and was cheap - $2000. after i got it i found, of course, that it wasn\\'t as good as i thought, and i went on a project for a few years upgrading it inside and out, though mechanically it was really pretty good. by the time 2002 came along, it was more than presentable and not bad at all for a car approaching 25 years of age. it was a good runner too, as these cars tended to be. in the fall of 2001 the buick presented itself, a total creampuff owned by an elderly gent who had given up the little driving he did, and it was a steal. i had to buy it. so now i owned 2 boats. i had the old fellow store the buick in his condo garage over the winter because i didn\\'t want to drive it in the slop. in march, two things happened. he started bugging me to get it out of his garage, so i reluctantly parked it in my driveway and the olds went to the curb outside my house. about a week later, we had a big ice storm. i remember hearing a big noise outside that saturday morning, looked out the window, and saw a massive section of a maple tree that was next to the street, laying in the street, next to the olds. i got dressed and went out to look at it. the fallen section was big enough that it was blocking the entire street. when it gave way, it raked the drivers side of the olds pretty good, mashing the front fender, ripping off the door mirror, and doing some other assorted damage. it was a city tree, and after some wrangling with them, their insurance company agreed to go good for the repair. i found a similar car in a junkyard, got the necessary repair parts for short money, and came out about $1000 ahead on the insurance claim. so after it was repaired, it looked better than ever, with fresh paint on the drivers side of the car, but it wasn\\'t getting much use since i was driving the buick. one day a knock comes at my door and there is a guy there wanting to know if that was my delta 88 and was i interested in selling it. he wanted it and i sold it for more than i paid originally. about a year later a similar thing happened. i was outside and a car pulls up. the guy gets out, wants to see the buick and after looking it over asks if i wanted to sell it. i did, and flipped it to him for a grand more than i had paid. he then went and had it professionally repainted, did some other small cosmetic things (it needed very little) and drove it for a while. i still see it occasionally around town, though he has sold it subsequently. it was nice to not have to work to sell two old tuna boats! i am reading the online version and i\\'m confused by the title for an article in the cincinnati enquirer this morning maybe i need another mug of coffee./n -------------------------------------------------------------page 1 wait, this discussion is limited to buying and selling cars?!?!  no razors, washing machines, air conditioners, etc?  i am outta here. i made an offer on a house last night...er, on topic, it has a two car garage and i only have one car at the moment. on the way to lunch with the realtor, we passed by a brgish used miata with a tan top. if we were already living here (las cruces), i would have grabbed the phone number. have seen a dozen or so convertibles in the last couple of days but only two had the tops down. congrats on the (potential) new house! was it perhaps too hot to have the tops down on the convertibles? <b>  an exotic purchase may be coming soon </b> in an earlier post i mentioned that i was considering ordering a used car directly from japan for my caribbean home. i am using a local broker and he sent me the below link. i went through the website and this white 1999 automatic, two-door, 4wd model caught my eye. it looks clean inside and out, especially the headlights. the mileage at 60,800 miles seems very reasonable.  price, including cost, insurance, and freight (cif) us$ 4,600. like *driver100, i want to have my own wheels rather than spend $70.00 a day on rentals. it\\'s a risk but one i am willing to take. any thoughts? looks nice enough. and not all that pricey. nothing to buy that\\'s already on the island? yes, but it would be twice as expensive. interesting to note, while we were in bermuda last week (absolutely beautiful place, with wonderful people living there, btw), i struck up a conversation with a person on the water taxi who has lived in bermuda all his life. he said they don\\'t have a personal income tax on the island.  but, just as a \"for example\", if you bought a new car, you pay 130% of the u.s. retail.  hmmmn...no wonder everyone drives mopeds/scooters and teeny cars there. it\\'s more than that - it\\'s a 150% tax and each household is allowed to own only 1 car.  there\\'s also an annual road tax based on the vehicle size that ranges from $250 to $1600 a year.  the goal of course is to reduce congestion.  it\\'s a tiny island. been there 3 times. you really don\\'t need a car. &gt; the salesperson i dealt with at bmw said that the back-end money goes to the owner at year end, but it doesn\\'t make it way down to the sales team. is that correct? in order to sell the car at invoice, he wanted to make sure i give them all 10s in the survey, which i guess helps them with some bonuses? and also the gm wanted to make sure i name our next child or grandchild after him we had no problem whatsoever getting around on their public busses and water taxis.  i can see where no car is needed....maybe the scooters would be a nice convenience. i actually spoke to one of the residents who was running a jewelry shop (all hand designed) in st george.  she said she was looking to move.  as she put it, it is a tiny island, and everyone knows everyone else\\'s business, to the point of intrusion. replying how i was shocked anyone would like to move from such a great place, the artist told me it was a scene out of \"twilight zone\" for her.....where she felt imprisoned by the island\\'s \"tiny-ness\", regardless of its great beauty. moral of the story.....never assume paradise is as beautiful to live in as it is to look at. gg  i, too, was quite enamored of bermuda.  had similar intersting conversations with the manager of a small art gallery in the hamilton princess hotel.  walked everywhere local in southampton and used the free water shuttle between the southampton and hamilton princess. i liked the odd (to me) assortment of small cars, the iirc, the pugeout hard top convertibles.  or maybe renaults?  mostly, the relaxed atmosphere (when not in a taxi/van!), beautiful warm water and, as you noted, equally warm people. ld...saw the peugot covertible.  also interesting, saw modern mgs/rovers there, too.  surprised there were no \"smart\" cars, though. found out they had a shortage of teachers (which peaked my wife\\'s interest) and pharmacists.  ordinarily, they fill positions as much as possible with the natives.  but, as their saying goes there, the biggest bermudean exports are people anr rum.  so, there are opportunities for both.  unless yoiu\\'re of bermudan ancestry, you can\\'t own land.  and, as one south african pharmicist told us, she could have her work visa withdrawn at any time if things change.  but, she\\'s been there 5 years, so far. we\\'ll go back...probably sooner rather than later. gee, it\\'s only been in the high 90s and cloudless. don\\'t know why the vert owners don\\'t have the tops down. wasn\\'t even any dust blowing around. my claim to fame on this new site will be the fact that i arrived here all by myself and even bookmarked it successfully.  as most of you know, this is quite a feat for me! one feature that i like very much is that i now get those email alerts that new posts are on the site.  we had that nice feature under the older system. richard i had similar converstaions regarding ownership.  as well as the relatively new concept of a measurable unemployment rate and the import of foreign workers.  and, of course, wealth! i hope to go back, with someone with whom i can share the experience... congratulations. glad to see you\\'re here. back in the 70s all the cars in bermuda where british.  that was cool seeing them. most never  made it over here. last year, my wife found a job posting for executive director of early childhood programs for bermuda. three year contract, paying something like $130k per year. we talked about it for, oh, about an hour before she decided she couldn\\'t leave her dogs behind for that long. since my work is on-line, i could have easily made the transition and worked from \"home\" there. although, i\\'m sure there would have been many distractions. speaking of rum, i still have a few bottles each of light and dark goslings 151 rum in the basement. from my honeymoon.  so quite aged at this point.  that is some powerful stuff.  rum swizzles that will burn your nose hairs. just a quick  thought from the uk.  remember, buying isn\\'t as expensive as you first think, you will be able to sell your car one day too.  also, it is nice to drive a car you actually like.  go for it! btw....this using a tablet with british internet is almost impossible. yes, good work getting here richard. i also have trouble remembering the title of the new site.  i have to try to find it and bookmark it on 4 computers including this tablet....w n inch is a real challenge. btw....bermuda is beautiful.  i believe they produce electricity from using generators that are in the ocean....work off ocean currents.  sounds like quite a system. be real careful of avoiding any car from the fukushima area.  the \"glow\" on the paint may not mean a great wax job. unfortunately, that never got off the ground.  the company that proposed it was based in my town and it\\'s founder is a prolific inventor.  but commercialization wasn\\'t fruitful so the technology isn\\'t being developed. bermuda relies on diesel generators powered by imported oil.  solar is starting to become a popular option as electricity is very expensive. but think of the wear and tear on your car delivering pizzas to the mainland. what am i missing?  who would spend that kind of money for a car with that milage...even a honda? not to mention that the seller is a dealer posting in the \"by owner\" section./n -------------------------------------------------------------page 2 it\\'s a stick.  so of course worth more! what can i say.  honda\\'s get crazy money, even with lots of miles.  that one probably has a lot of life left in it too.  at least you don\\'t have to worry about the at crapping out on you. no one shies away from big mile hondas! michaell...that had to be a tough decision.   any particular reason you couldn\\'t take the dogs with you? stick...did a rum cruise while in bermuda...sponsored bpy goslings.  that 151 put us back in our cruise cabin early. we didn\\'t look into it that closely ... and my wife was looking or a \"smaller\" job at the time, not a bigger one , missed your reply earlier - we hit the art museum today and enjoyed a \"small paintings\" from cheech marin\\'s collection. we\\'re heading back to the up tomorrow, having enjoyed a nice spell of \"mild\" weather here this week - don\\'t think it got over 95. the ac on the \\'09 grand caravan we picked up a few weeks back is blowing nice and cold at 125k. in an earlier post i mentioned that i was considering ordering a used car directly from japan for my caribbean home. i am using a local broker and he sent me the below link. i went through the website and this white 1999 automatic, two-door, 4wd model caught my eye. it looks clean inside and out, especially the headlights. the mileage at 60,800 miles seems very reasonable. price, including cost, insurance, and freight (cif) us$ 4,600. like *driver100, i want to have my own wheels rather than spend $70.00 a day on rentals. it\\'s a risk but one i am willing to take. any thoughts? excellent point but how does one verify that the car is not from that area? i believe the japanese government had placed a moratorium on the movement of people and property from the fukushima area to prevent such incidents. nonetheless, the price, appearance and mileage is extremely attractive to me, though one of my daughter\\'s is dismayed that i would consider buying a 15 year old vehicle. michaell....we spoke about what it would take to pack up and move to bermuda (not very seriously).  sell my house.  packup and move belongings/cars, etc 1200 miles to bermuda.  find a place to rent (not alowed to buy).  i can\\'t even fathom what it would cost to move that much, that distance, over water. the wife could teach.  me?  not sure if i could do what i do there.  it certainly would mean a lot more traveling for me, if i could even swing it.  i told her i could set up a little shop over by the dockyards or in hamilton to sell internet service, water, etc.  i know there is a wifi provider by the cruise ship docks.  but, it\\'s not very far reaching and pretty darn slow.  i know i could do better.  plus, selling refreshments and souvenirs sounds like a low stress job for me (something i\\'d welcome). hmmmmm????????  i wonder!!!!!!!!!!!! like your daughter, i,too, am a little dismayed that you would purchase a 15 year old car sight unseen from overseas.  i don\\'t wish to dampen your buying spirit, but age is age.  though the appearance and mileage seem attractive, i would have to wonder about all of the inner workings and hidden parts.  what do you know at this point about the transmission, braking system, ac/heat system, undercarriage rust, etc.  another factor is that you can\\'t run down to see the dealer if there is a major problem with your purchase.  i could be wrong, but i think that you are a bit unsure yourself.  remember---if in doubt, don\\'t act.  best wishes with this decision. richard while you are wondering, i\\'ll help you out a little on shipping your personal belongings.  one car will be around $2,000 to $3,000 and, depending on poundage, expect to pay a minimum of $5,000 for a small house load.  with furniture, it\\'s often better to purchase new when you arrive in the country.  you can sell it to an x-pat if you decide to come home.  same with the car.  american cars are often sought after to use as taxies.  personally, i would ship nothing and keep my home here, at least for 2 or 3 years.  if you decide to stay forever, you can sell your home here later.  during the interim, you can rent your home here or just put a monitor on it and watch it from bermuda.  rent in bermuda won\\'t be cheap. teaching school there will be different.  moving to another country is a major decision---requires much thought and preparation. richard all excellent advice. in our brief discussion, we figured we\\'d keep everything we have in colorado - daughter would continue to live in it - and rent what we needed in bermuda. given that the wife\\'s new salary would have been almost 3x what she was making at the time, we could have afforded a 1 or 2 bedroom place there. i was fascinated with the choice in cars - lots of things not available in the us. though i suspect that a scooter would suffice for a majority of the transportation needs. richard and micheall....just day dreaming.  that would be a huge lifestyle change.  not that it would be a bad one.  but, i\\'m pretty tied to the lifestyle and geographic area i live in now. if i were in my 20s?  maybe even 30s?  no wife?  i could see myself chucking it all here and making that move, though. besides, i would own the biggest car on the island, as well as the most unique.  don\\'t recall seeing any acura tls there. in the past i\\'ve given some serious thought to movign to puerto rico....u.s. holding, tropical climate, cosmopolitan area. when i was talking about that, friends asked why i just didn\\'t move to florida. no offense to mike, but florida just doesn\\'t \"do it\" for me. richard, you are indeed a wise man. to use *driver\\'s banished word, i have a dilemma. my local agent suggested a 2002 rav4 with 35,000 miles for us $7,300 cif. (japanese cars tend to be low mileage because of limited opportunities for long-distance driving). the killer (pardon the pun) of this deal is the additional local governmental charges in st. lucia that tacks another us $12,000 for customs duties, vat taxes and an environmental tax for vehicles over 5 years old. that\\'s a total cost of almost us $20,000 for a 12-year old car. wintering in the caribbean is great but it can be an expensive proposition. oh, the price we pay for love (wife). i\\'d look a lot closer at p.r. before making the move. the economy sucks and crime is at an all time high. &gt; what!  you don\\'t like high humidity &amp; heat, mixed with bugs in huge numbers?  to say nothing of the industrial-grade old folks, with their driving \"anomailes.\" imagine. i really do like jacksonville---beautiful city, very clean, very friendly, and easy to navigate.  weather---not too hot and not too cool.  my sister and bil have a lovely third home in port st. lucie, but i\\'m not attracted to that area, though vero beach is nice for eating and shopping.  btw, bil has passed his six month survival mark by two weeks.  i think that he\\'s trying to hold out for the children who arrive from dubai next wednesday.  only 5 more days and we\\'ll pray for each one of those. richard here\\'s hoping it all works out and that your bil can see the kids one more time. that post already got flagged and removed. well, someone (don\\'t remember who) posted a cl ad about some dealer was posing as a private seller.  when i clicked on the link provided there was a message from cl saying that ad had been flagged and deleted. now, it appears the post i had responded to was also deleted. i\\'m not going nuts....really! now, it appears the post i had responded to was also deleted. not so. isell\\'s was commenting on the my post where i wondered why someone would pay close to $6k for a honda with 190,000 miles.  the cl ad i posted was indeed flagged and removed no doubt because it was recognized as a dealer posting in the \"by owner\" section. many small dealers are too cheap to pay the $5 craigslist charges for \"by dealer\" listings.  personally i don\\'t trust such a dealer because first of all, if they\\'re too cheap to spend 5 bucks how much are they spending to recondition the car.  also it just seem dishonest for a dealer to misrepresent themselves as a private seller. my original post is still there. it\\'s an either/or. my guess, it decides which one is going to be sooner every time the routine runs, and that is what gets displayed. maybe you are right on the border where it is going to be close whether you hit miles or time sooner? great but you misnamed it, it should be \"the forum about buying and selling cars where we talk about everything buy buying and selling cars.\" several years ago i did that and found out the state had something of mine. i filled out the paperwork and sent in the proper paperwork and got a check for a whopping $0.35. turns out that i got one last dividend check from the one share of at&amp;t stock i had gotten from my aunt before i dumped it that never got to me. it can be too hot to have the top down? i don\\'t believe it./n -------------------------------------------------------------page 3 a few years ago my sister would have been all over that. she was a rural route carrier for the post office and would have loved to have gotten another right hand drive truck. or they could do what mackinac island did and outright ban motorized vehicles. next month we are taking a long weekend and going up there with our bikes to tour the island. hate to tell you this but once a spirit is bottled it stops aging. we keep talking about going over there before we move from the up in a couple of months. and we do drive right by the ferry docks when we go visit family in tn and va that way (we\\'re above da bridge). but, we didn\\'t make it to isle royale either. once we move to nm, the plan was to buy a new downsized car, but the used van we just got is working out well so far. so who knows. oh i am very well aware of that, but of late if we didn\\'t talk about other things the forum we would be a long way from 100k posts on sftsf forum. well, i guess it\\'s proof that they can go the distance but would you buy it? i am inclined to agree with with *stickguy; its miles or days which ever comes first. this leads to another question, why mb does not alert you by email as gm does with onstar? the onstar report shows the status for a number of engine functions including telematics and tire pressure. speaking of service, i read the buick encore 24-month \"free service\" a little closer. it says  a maximum of four free services in the 2-year period and it does not include air filters. nice marketing gimmick that basically boils down to a few oil changes. and tire rotations farmer, the i6 is extremely durable engine.  if you are willing to maintain the car ($$) right, no reason it can\\'t go that far.  just have to replace the various valves and sensors (commonly known failure points) as needed, and keep up with fluids. that particular car?  pass, with the body damage. durable engine or not it is still 15 years old with nearly 200k miles on it. that makes it a crap shoot regardless of the price, to much of a possibility that it would be a rolling money pit. cheerio from the ferrie from wales to ireland...4 hours! wi fi is on and off and days are long.  i\\'ll have to catch up when i get back...mon june 30. richard i saw the post with your student who had a sign...10 items or fewer.  probably the only grammatically correct supermarket in the usa! i think that i have spoken too soon.  i mentioned that i was happy to be receiving an email alert when people post on this forum.  now i am receiving an email alert for every single post!  this could turn into a nightmare on a busy day for my inbox.  is this happening to anyone else?  my question is this can my account be alerted once a day like it used to be and, if not, how do i turn off the email alert for this site?  i could just use my bookmark once or twice a day to check on posts here.  help! richard i turned off the notifications.  there were i believe different options (all new posts, replay to my post) but i don\\'t need the emails.  i just check in and see what is in the bookmarks. richard, i leave this site up 24 hrs along with a few others so that when i hit refresh, it goes to where i left off and i just scroll down. you don\\'t need an email stating there are new posts...there will always be new posts. (especially when driver gets back from his vacation). i mentioned that i was happy to be receiving an email alert when people post on this forum. this is the page you need. uncheck some of the notification boxes. to get there, click on your username in the box at the right on every page. then click on \"edit profile\" then click on \"notification preferences.\" then uncheck the types of notication you don\\'t want. these are the ones i have checked as long as you have clicked on the star at the top of \"buying and selling cars...\" and it is yellow, this topic will show up in the your bookmarked list just like the \"stories from the sales frontlines\" used to do (still does). thanks guys!  what a help you are to a friend in need.  i bragged too soon as well.  i may have gotten here by myself and bookmarked the site correctly, but, as you can see, i still needed my poster buddies to get me straight.  thanks again! richard heck yes it can be too hot to have the top down! it can be bad enough around here where 80 degrees is a heat wave but try driving top down in phoenix in august!  you won\\'t have that top down for long! i like the mornings and late afternoons the best but not when the sun is beating down on my head! wow, there must be a huge gap between invoice and msrp on toyotas or a ton of trunk money!  hondas never had that kind of room! it\\'s funny.  people say they don\\'t want to dicker that they just want a great price so they go through costco, autobytel, tru-value and the many others that have come and gone. so, we comply with their wishes.  \" here is the msrp, here is our invoice and here is your costco price\"  i can count the times on three fingers when they would say \" wow, that\\'s a great stress free way to buy a car...i\\'ll take it, craig\" nope, instead i would hear..\" that sounds high...can\\'t you do better\"  at that point i was in dangerous territory.  i had given them a price to go shop all over the state. instead, i would say \" if you have another number in mind and are committed to buy the car and drive it home today, i\\'ll write that number down and run it by my boss\" if they wouldn\\'t do that i would say..\" according to costco\\'s rules that number is the most i can charge you...if you plan to shop my number at least give me the chance to respond...i\\'m not going to lose your business over a few dollars\" \" i\\'ll be back\" \" don\\'t count the be-backs, count the greenbacks\"! the question is why? edmunds shows $1000 to customer if they don\\'t take any reduced rate financing. so there must be quite a bit of hidden factory to dealer money as the end of the model year approaches. why is he buying the stripper base camry? local screamer dealer is offering $4000 off on all 2014 vw gtis.  is that good? not a vw guy but that sounds like a lot. i like the part where it says \"notify me when people write on my wall\" i\\'d like the police notified. a base stirippo tan camry is the perfect old persons car.  heck, they all get driven that way anyway. there are some serious deals on those i see advertised, so i can believe that deal.  if my daughter actually needed a car to take (far) away to college in a few months, a cheap lease on one of those would probably be the winner (or an altima)./n -------------------------------------------------------------page 4'"
