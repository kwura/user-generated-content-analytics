"June 18, 2014  3:53PM",graphicguy,   i'm 2nd post....yee haw!!!!!!!!    do i get a badge? 
"June 18, 2014  4:01PM",bwia,"   great, but will it be possible to refer to old thread?    and one more thing how do i find and add a discussion to ""my bookmarks?"" "
"June 18, 2014  4:08PM",imidazol97,"   if you have posted in that discussion, click on ""participated"" and all your past post topics are chronologically listed.    if you are looking for a brand or model or a keyword, use the ""car forums"" link at the top left of this page to get some ways of searching for models, brands, keywords, or poster names. "
"June 18, 2014  4:21PM",stickguy,"   if you want to bookmark this one, there is a little 5 point star next to the title up above.  just click that and it turns yellow. "
"June 18, 2014  4:43PM",bwia,"   thanks  , it worked like a charm. "
"June 18, 2014  4:49PM",bwia,   thanks imidazol97. i will try that later but stickguy's approach works for me.    thanks for that. while this new board loads faster it just seems a little cumbersome and not very user friendly. 
"June 18, 2014  4:51PM",Kirstie_H,"   no, but it's almost like you're famous.  just think, if this discussion goes on for years and years like the other did, visitors loading this discussion for the very first time will see your name associated with the first member post.  and i gave you a ""like.""    re the old discussion.  i'm not sure what will become of it.  this is the first one we're retiring on the new platform.  hopefully it can be archived. "
"June 18, 2014  5:35PM",cdnpinhead,"   okay, here am i also.  now i need to add this to what shows up on my list.    looks like i've done it.    something tells me we won't get to 100k on this one anytime soon, but one never knows. "
"June 18, 2014  5:39PM",graphicguy,   wow!  i'm almost famous....... thanks...... 
"June 18, 2014  5:50PM",ab348,"   wow, that's a throwback to the old, old, old board software (well engaged? i forget its name) where you had to do this all the time to keep a discussion going after a certain number of posts.    the more things change... "
"June 18, 2014  5:51PM",ab348,   agreed. it is very dumb and complex at the same time. 
"June 18, 2014  6:18PM",mako1a,   we don't even have a page number yet. talk about new! 
"June 18, 2014  6:25PM",laurasdada,"   well, you may be almost famous.  but are you a golden god, tiny dancer? "
"June 18, 2014  6:34PM",Michaell,"   having been through the archives just a few months ago, i saw all the discussions 'blah blah blah #6' and 'blah blah blah #7', where post #1 was a canned statement from the (then) host about this being a continuation.    iirc, the limit then was pretty small (1000 posts?). at least with 100k posts before we have to close it down it will take some time. if we average 25 posts a day, that's about 9000 a year - would take 11 years to get to 100k posts again.    c'mon, people, i'm sure we can average more than 25 a day. "
"June 18, 2014  6:40PM",kyfdx,   anyone have an actual story about buying or selling a car? 
"June 18, 2014  6:41PM",houdini1,"   minnie pearl    ""i'm just so proud to be here"" !!  probably not many will remember that one. at least i got on the first page. "
"June 18, 2014  6:50PM",imidazol97,   we were discussing what is the real invoice number. i believe the invoice numbers have been raised such as those shown in edmunds to fool the purchaser. it's my feeling profit margin at least double that indicated by the reported invoice. i operated on that basis negotiating my chevrolet purchase. 
"June 18, 2014  7:17PM",graphicguy,   ld....got the reference!!!!! 
"June 18, 2014  8:04PM",stever,"   i bought one and sold two in the last 3 weeks. one sold with a sign on it and the other one went to a craigslist responder an hour out of town. the used van we bought came from a dealer 20 minutes away after we did a three day road trip down to wisconsin and test drove eight or so new cars down there, and tested another 4 or 5 vans within an hour of home.    i almost lost the local sale of my '97 outback. the buyer saw the sign, drove the car and went home and raided his strongbox, all within an hour. then i screwed up the title and had to wait until the next morning to talk to dmv (the joys of a small town, no line and the woman fixed it in 2 minutes). meanwhile the buyer was having a little remorse and thought he heard a wheel bearing noise. so i knocked $100 off and since then i've seen him cruising around a lot. he claimed he was going to check it out and then give it to his daughter, but the way he had shined it up, i bet he keeps it for himself. it was a great winter ride.    the van ""sold"" sight unseen and while i was waiting for the buyer to drive the hour to my house to pick it up, i could have sold it to a local guy that was sort of a distant relation. that after it had been on craigslist a week and on the street with a sign on it for several days with zero interest. go figure. "
"June 18, 2014  8:11PM",laurasdada,"   not yet.  but, i could retell my fabulous jos a. bank story!    if only i had cashed in my 401k/ira prior to the greenwich concours... "
"June 18, 2014  9:03PM",graphicguy,"   not a sales story, but a sales question(s)/observation.  it's no secret that my two favorite brands of cars are acura and bmw (not neccessarily in that order)..  bmw's are fair in retaining their value, hurt by the fact that bmw coroporate offers sizeable subsidies on their value to make the leases more attrative.  yet, they still sell for a premium on the used market.    another one, acura, is known as being the brand that has one of the best resale values among all brands, have been discounting their cars, as in the case with the new acura, over $10k off msrp.  so, the question here is, even though the previous rl was also heavily discounted, the resale value doesn't ""appear"" to be affected.    am i missing a piece of the puzzle here? "
"June 18, 2014  9:27PM",Kirstie_H,"   it was 500 posts, so that's quite a few less than 100k.  it took us more than 8 years to get to 100k. "
"June 18, 2014  9:34PM",driver100,"   well, i am the first person to post from london england.  that joseph el banks story is going to get lost in  the archives.  i may be the first person to post here using a ford tab10.  all i can repo r t is there are lots of mercedes here....about 15x as many as bmw! "
"June 18, 2014 10:45PM",kyfdx,"   i think it's been that way for a long time, though it may be getting worse.   for instance, bmw don't have ""holdback"", but it's common knowledge that there is 5% of invoice of back-end money that bmw pays the dealer (which varies by csi scores and volume)..    and, some makes have such thin margins between msrp and invoice, that there has to be more money on the back end (volvo comes to mind). "
"June 18, 2014 11:57PM",imidazol97,   i received a letter addressed to the previous owners of our home. it's from a company wanting to reunited them with their unclaimed funds from somewhere in exchange for 20% of the unstated amount. or they want to find their heirs for the same commission goal.    i looked up the folks who used to live here and i find a mortgage company in florida and a sears amount in tx for more than $100 out of the states participating in the treasure hunt unclaimed funds page. none here in ohio for the folks.    is it likely that's what the company is wanting to get 20% of? --something related to the mortgage? either insurance refund or a settlement from the large mortgage company?    i hope i can find the folks to forward this information that there may be missing money owed to them. 
"June 19, 2014 12:18AM",stickguy,"   speaking of missing money, recently someone that works with my wife said she saw out name on the nj missing funds list.  apparently there is a website where you can search by name to see what comes up.  she must have had some, so looked for other people she knew. and out name popped up.    was obviously us, because the address was a bastardized mix of 1/2 our current, and 1/2 our last one.  and the date was in 1997, right around when we moved.  so, i filled out the couple of online question, and a few weeks later we got a legal looking form from the state.  filled that out, and got it notarized, and sent it back.  and yup, in a few weeks, a check showed up.    i never did figure out what it was from (obviously related to the house closing), but it would have been exceptionally easy for whoever had the money to find us, if they ever bothered to look. instead, nj used our money interest free for a decade! "
"June 19, 2014 12:19AM",stickguy,"   and i almost had a shopping story today.  had to take my daughter over to the mall late in the afternoon to get a graduation dress (for her, not me!)  and we planned to stop at the volvo dealer, alas, it got too late, and the traffic at rush hour is nasty over that way, so we will have to do it some other time. "
"June 19, 2014 12:24AM",imidazol97,"   is a group of several states that share their information on unclaimed funds. otherwise, check each state in which you lived or did business for unclaimed funds. "
"June 19, 2014 12:25AM",ab348,"   the last 2 cars i sold myself, i wasn't actually actively selling.    in 2003 my fleet consisted of a '78 olds delta 88 4-door, a '79 buick electra 225 buick, and my '68 cutlass. yes, in 2003.    i'll leave the cutlass out of this as it is a hobby car. for years when i lived and worked downtown, it was the only car i had. i walked most everywhere i needed to go. when i bought a house away from downtown in 1997, i needed a beater, and wanted a rear-drive car, preferably an olds since i was familiar with the engine. the '78 delta i found had a rocket 350, was in reasonable shape, and was cheap - $2000. after i got it i found, of course, that it wasn't as good as i thought, and i went on a project for a few years upgrading it inside and out, though mechanically it was really pretty good. by the time 2002 came along, it was more than presentable and not bad at all for a car approaching 25 years of age. it was a good runner too, as these cars tended to be.    in the fall of 2001 the buick presented itself, a total creampuff owned by an elderly gent who had given up the little driving he did, and it was a steal. i had to buy it. so now i owned 2 boats. i had the old fellow store the buick in his condo garage over the winter because i didn't want to drive it in the slop. in march, two things happened. he started bugging me to get it out of his garage, so i reluctantly parked it in my driveway and the olds went to the curb outside my house. about a week later, we had a big ice storm. i remember hearing a big noise outside that saturday morning, looked out the window, and saw a massive section of a maple tree that was next to the street, laying in the street, next to the olds.    i got dressed and went out to look at it. the fallen section was big enough that it was blocking the entire street. when it gave way, it raked the drivers side of the olds pretty good, mashing the front fender, ripping off the door mirror, and doing some other assorted damage. it was a city tree, and after some wrangling with them, their insurance company agreed to go good for the repair. i found a similar car in a junkyard, got the necessary repair parts for short money, and came out about $1000 ahead on the insurance claim. so after it was repaired, it looked better than ever, with fresh paint on the drivers side of the car, but it wasn't getting much use since i was driving the buick. one day a knock comes at my door and there is a guy there wanting to know if that was my delta 88 and was i interested in selling it. he wanted it and i sold it for more than i paid originally.    about a year later a similar thing happened. i was outside and a car pulls up. the guy gets out, wants to see the buick and after looking it over asks if i wanted to sell it. i did, and flipped it to him for a grand more than i had paid. he then went and had it professionally repainted, did some other small cosmetic things (it needed very little) and drove it for a while. i still see it occasionally around town, though he has sold it subsequently. it was nice to not have to work to sell two old tuna boats! "
"June 19, 2014 12:35PM",imidazol97,   i am reading the online version and i'm confused by the title for an  article in the cincinnati enquirer this morning      maybe i need another mug of coffee.

"June 19, 2014  1:29PM",stever,"   i made an offer on a house last night...er, on topic, it has a two car garage and i only have one car at the moment. on the way to lunch with the realtor, we passed by a brgish used miata with a tan top. if we were already living here (las cruces), i would have grabbed the phone number.    have seen a dozen or so convertibles in the last couple of days but only two had the tops down.

"June 19, 2014  1:45PM",Michaell,   congrats on the (potential) new house!    was it perhaps too hot to have the tops down on the convertibles?

"June 19, 2014  2:26PM",stickguy,   looks nice enough. and not all that pricey. 
"June 19, 2014  2:42PM",kyfdx,   nothing to buy that's already on the island? 
"June 19, 2014  2:51PM",bwia,"   yes, but it would be twice as expensive. "
"June 19, 2014  3:26PM",graphicguy,"   interesting to note, while we were in bermuda last week (absolutely beautiful place, with wonderful people living there, btw), i struck up a connissantion with a person on the water taxi who has lived in bermuda all his life.    he said they don't have a personal income tax on the island.  but, just as a ""for example"", if you bought a new car, you pay 130% of the u.s. retail.  hmmmn...no wonder everyone drives mopeds/scooters and teeny cars there. "
"June 19, 2014  3:35PM",robr2,   it's more than that - it's a 150% tax and each household is allowed to own only 1 car.  there's also an annual road tax based on the vehicle size that ranges from $250 to $1600 a year.  the goal of course is to reduce congestion.  it's a tiny island. 
"June 19, 2014  5:26PM",stickguy,   been there 3 times. you really don't need a car. 
"June 19, 2014  5:38PM",abacomike,"  ""if we were already living here (las cruces), i would have grabbed the phone number."" i've been to las cruces a few times.  great place to vacation.  the art colony is outstanding and a must see for visitors. good luck - and make sure your air-conditioning is working properly.  it gets hot out there at times."
"June 19, 2014  6:05PM",justg0,"       the salesperson i dealt with at bmw said that the back-end money goes to the owner at year end, but it doesn't make it way down to the sales team. is that correct?    in order to sell the car at invoice, he wanted to make sure i give them all 10s in the survey, which i guess helps them with some bonuses?    and also the gm wanted to make sure i name our next child or grandchild after him "
"June 19, 2014  6:13PM",graphicguy,"   we had no problem whatsoever getting around on their public busses and water taxis.  i can see where no car is needed....maybe the scooters would be a nice convenience.    i actually spoke to one of the residents who was running a jewelry shop (all hand designed) in st george.  she said she was looking to move.  as she put it, it is a tiny island, and everyone knows everyone else's business, to the point of intrusion.    replying how i was shocked anyone would like to move from such a great place, the artist told me it was a scene out of ""twilight zone"" for her.....where she felt imprisoned by the island's ""tiny-ness"", regardless of its great beauty.    moral of the story.....never assume paradise is as beautiful to live in as it is to look at. "
"June 19, 2014  6:38PM",laurasdada,"   gg  i, too, was quite enamored of bermuda.  had similar intersting connissantions with the manager of a small art gallery in the hamilton princess hotel.  walked everywhere local in southampton and used the free water shuttle between the southampton and hamilton princess.    i liked the odd (to me) assortment of small cars, the iirc, the pugeout hard top convertibles.  or maybe renaults?  mostly, the relaxed atmosphere (when not in a taxi/van!), beautiful warm water and, as you noted, equally warm people. "
"June 19, 2014  6:55PM",graphicguy,"   ld...saw the peugot covertible.  also interesting, saw modern mgs/rovers there, too.  surprised there were no ""smart"" cars, though.    found out they had a shortage of teachers (which peaked my wife's interest) and pharmacists.  ordinarily, they fill positions as much as possible with the natives.  but, as their saying goes there, the biggest bermudean exports are people anr rum.  so, there are opportunities for both.  unless yoiu're of bermudan ancestry, you can't own land.  and, as one south african pharmicist told us, she could have her work visa withdrawn at any time if things change.  but, she's been there 5 years, so far.    we'll go back...probably sooner rather than later.

"June 19, 2014  7:25PM",stickguy,   back in the 70s all the cars in bermuda where british.  that was cool seeing them. most never  made it over here. 
"June 19, 2014  7:55PM",Michaell,"   last year, my wife found a job posting for executive director of early childhood progdodges for bermuda. three year contract, paying something like $130k per year. we talked about it for, oh, about an hour before she decided she couldn't leave her dogs behind for that long.    since my work is on-line, i could have easily made the transition and worked from ""home"" there. although, i'm sure there would have been many distractions.

"June 19, 2014  8:38PM",driver100,"   just a quick  thought from the uk.  remember, buying isn't as expensive as you first think, you will be able to sell your car one day too.  also, it is nice to drive a car you actually like.  go for it!    btw....this using a tablet with british internet is almost impossible.

"June 19, 2014  8:43PM",driver100,"   yes, good work getting here richard.    i also have trouble remembering the title of the new site.  i have to try to find it and bookmark it on 4 computers including this tablet....w n inch is a real challenge.    btw....bermuda is beautiful.  i believe they produce electricity from using generators that are in the ocean....work off ocean currents.  sounds like quite a system.

"June 20, 2014  1:37PM",bwia,"   in an earlier post i mentioned that i was considering ordering a used car directly from japan for my caribbean home. i am using a local broker and he sent me the below link.    i went through the website and this white 1999 automatic, two-door, 4wd model caught my eye. it looks clean inside and out, especially the headlights. the mileage at 60,800 miles seems very reasonable. price, including cost, insurance, and freight (cif) us$ 4,600.    like *driver100, i want to have my own wheels rather than spend $70.00 a day on rentals. it's a risk but one i am willing to take.    any thoughts?    excellent point but how does one verify that the car is not from that area? i believe the japanese government had placed a moratorium on the movement of people and property from the fukushima area to prevent such incidents.    nonetheless, the price, appearance and mileage is extremely attractive to me, though one of my daughter's is dismayed that i would consider buying a 15 year old vehicle. "
"June 20, 2014  2:14PM",graphicguy,"   michaell....we spoke about what it would take to pack up and move to bermuda (not very seriously).  sell my house.  packup and move belongings/cars, etc 1200 miles to bermuda.  find a place to rent (not alowed to buy).  i can't even fathom what it would cost to move that much, that distance, over water.    the wife could teach.  me?  not sure if i could do what i do there.  it certainly would mean a lot more traveling for me, if i could even swing it.  i told her i could set up a little shop over by the dockyards or in hamilton to sell internet service, water, etc.  i know there is a wifi provider by the cruise ship docks.  but, it's not very far reaching and pretty darn slow.  i know i could do better.  plus, selling refreshments and souvenirs sounds like a low stress job for me (something i'd welcome).    hmmmmm????????  i wonder!!!!!!!!!!!! "
"June 20, 2014  2:15PM",sterlingdog,"   like your daughter, i,too, am a little dismayed that you would purchase a 15 year old car sight unseen from overseas.  i don't wish to dampen your buying spirit, but age is age.  though the appearance and mileage seem attractive, i would have to wonder about all of the inner workings and hidden parts.  what do you know at this point about the transmission, braking system, ac/heat system, undercarriage rust, etc.  another factor is that you can't run down to see the dealer if there is a major problem with your purchase.  i could be wrong, but i think that you are a bit unsure yourself.  remember---if in doubt, don't act.  best wishes with this decision.    richard "
"June 20, 2014  2:40PM",sterlingdog,"   while you are wondering, i'll help you out a little on shipping your personal belongings.  one car will be around $2,000 to $3,000 and, depending on poundage, expect to pay a minimum of $5,000 for a small house load.  with furniture, it's often better to purchase new when you arrive in the country.  you can sell it to an x-pat if you decide to come home.  same with the car.  american cars are often sought after to use as taxies.  personally, i would ship nothing and keep my home here, at least for 2 or 3 years.  if you decide to stay forever, you can sell your home here later.  during the interim, you can rent your home here or just put a monitor on it and watch it from bermuda.  rent in bermuda won't be cheap. teaching school there will be different.  moving to another country is a major decision---requires much thought and preparation.    richard "
"June 20, 2014  2:53PM",Michaell,"   all excellent advice.    in our brief discussion, we figured we'd keep everything we have in colorado - daughter would continue to live in it - and rent what we needed in bermuda. given that the wife's new salary would have been almost 3x what she was making at the time, we could have afforded a 1 or 2 bedroom place there.    i was fascinated with the choice in cars - lots of things not available in the us. though i suspect that a scooter would suffice for a majority of the transportation needs.

"June 20, 2014  3:27PM",graphicguy,"   richard and micheall....just day dreaming.  that would be a huge lifestyle change.  not that it would be a bad one.  but, i'm pretty tied to the lifestyle and geographic area i live in now.    if i were in my 20s?  maybe even 30s?  no wife?  i could see myself chucking it all here and making that move, though.    besides, i would own the biggest car on the island, as well as the most unique.  don't recall seeing any acura tls there.    in the past i've given some serious thought to movign to puerto rico....u.s. holding, tropical climate, cosmopolitan area.    when i was talking about that, friends asked why i just didn't move to florida.    no offense to mike, but florida just doesn't ""do it"" for me.

"June 20, 2014  3:36PM",bwia,"   richard, you are indeed a wise man. to use *driver's banished word, i have a dilemma. my local agent suggested a 2002 rav4 with 35,000 miles for us $7,300 cif. (japanese cars tend to be low mileage because of limited opportunities for long-distance driving).    the killer (pardon the pun) of this deal is the additional local governmental charges in st. lucia that tacks another us $12,000 for customs duties, vat taxes and an environmental tax for vehicles over 5 years old. that's a total cost of almost us $20,000 for a 12-year old car.    wintering in the caribbean is great but it can be an expensive proposition. oh, the price we pay for love (wife). "
"June 20, 2014  3:38PM",abacomike,"  ""no offense to mike, but florida just doesn't ""do it"" for me."" i got news for you, the part of florida i live in doesn't do it for me either.  but ponte vedra beach would.  that's where my brother lives - 25 miles south of jacksonville and 35 miles north of st. augustine - perfect! the weather in the fall and winter is similar to that in nc and sc and coastal ga.  very little traffic and a perfect climate. there are some very nice places in fl if you look carefully.  panama beach is another great place to live."

"June 21, 2014  2:01AM",abacomike," """"service reminders"""" most of the newer model vehicles (bmw, mercedes, audi, gm, etc.) have reminders when a service is needed.  i know *driver100's bmw 535 alerts him when the next oil chane is required.  in my mercedes, it alerts me by ""tone"" as well as a pop-up alert on my instrument cluster screen (not the nav screen). about a week ago, a message alert popped up on my screen which stated the next ""a service"" was due in 170 days.  there are 2 types of service - an a and a b.  then, today, another message popped up stating the next ""a service"" was due in 4500 miles. my question is why does it alert me in ""days"" to the next service and ""miles"" to the next service?  sometimes days, sometimes miles.  why not one or the other? could it be progdodgemed to measure oil condition, vehicle use, temperatures, engine wear, etc?  i looked it up on an online manual and all it says is when a certain type of service is needed, an alert will pop up as a message.  also that reminders will pop up routinely. any ideas about how this works?"
"June 21, 2014  3:05AM",stickguy,"   it's an either/or. my guess, it decides which one is going to be sooner every time the routine runs, and that is what gets displayed. maybe you are right on the border where it is going to be close whether you hit miles or time sooner? "

"June 21, 2014  8:52PM",abacomike," ""sales experience"" my downstairs neighbor went to the toyota dealership yesterday and called me this morning to ask if i could get him a good deal on a new toyota.  i agreed to accompany him back at noon this afternoon. we met the salesman who worked with him yesterday at 1215 pm this afternoon.  the car he was looking at was a 2014 toyota le 4 cyl base car with cloth interior.  msrp was $24,523 and the edmunds tru-value price $21,523. he wanted a better deal than the tru-value price.  the dealer had offered to sell the car for $22,125 + dealer fees of $599.  i showed him my old business card and told him we would buy the car right now for $20,000 including dealer fees + tax, tags and title fees. after about 20 minutes, as expected, he returned with the manager.  he introduced himself and asked if i knew what the invoice price of the car was.  i responded $22,418, but edmunds tru-value price was $21,523.  i told him i knew the 2015's were due out with a complete re-styling in a few weeks and that we were buying a car that would be worth thousands less because of the new model. he asked if we would consider a red sedan, and i then said, in front of the manager, that we were on our way to an autonation dealership where i knew i could get my price.  he relented and gave us the deal i proposed - $20,000 including fees +tax +tags + title.  he drove his car home with me following in my car.  luckily he had no trade as he was selling his old car to one of the guys in the building next to ours. i am sure he still made a few bucks because there are some great incentives available to the dealer to reduce their 2014 inventories. the edmunds tru-market value pricing is a good start, but there are better deals out there if you know how to negotiate. now, one of my dad's old volkswagening buddies wants me to help him buy a new sonata.  i figure what the heck - i have nothing else to do with my time and dad appreciated my consenting to help one of his old cronies."

"June 21, 2014 11:26PM",stickguy,"   would not be surprised.  the 2015s are on the ground (i saw 2 of them thursday at the dealer, and they are very nice, and imo a big improvement), so the 14's are day old bread at this point.  still, they don't tend to have that many in stock, so a bit surprising they are knocking off that much (unless of course they are working off a dealer addendum sticker to cook the books).    i should probably add volkswagen dealers to the list of places i better stay away from.

"June 22, 2014  2:50AM",stickguy,"   so richard, what are the prime contenders at this point?    and i enjoyed watching the open last week and seeing shots of pinehurst.  looked like a beautiful town.  but probably horrible to be there during a major tournament. "
"June 22, 2014 12:03PM",bwia,"   that's what i have been saying all along, that so-called ""invoice"" price is as phony as a three dollar bill. how can a company sell a product with a 5% or 15% gross margin and expect to survive? it cannot be done.    the historical average gross margin for all american companies is about 40%, so what makes auto dealerships any different? a good example of that is to look at how the auto dealer service department price their services.    the labor rate includes a base price plus a built in profit margin as well as an additional amount to cover overhead. the same formula is used for parts. the mark-up on parts includes an amount to cover both overhead and a built in profit margin.    by extension, if we apply this pricing formula to the sale of the car itself we can see that invoice is quite meaningless. even the so-called experts, hondaing to usa today, said they didn't know what invoice is/was, yet they continue to publish this dribble. "
"June 22, 2014 12:15PM",imidazol97,"   what has occurred is that the companies have insulated themselves from transparency in the pricing. they reacted to the publication of their invoice price and the other cost factors by developing other systems which the public has no ability to collect information about. lack of transparency. and they have good lobby systems. here in ohio, the law is written that allows dealers to collect a document fee, up to $250, on time contracts (loans). however, the dealers use that as a mandatory doc fee always at the maxiumum. they already have it printed on their contract. so someone paying cash doesn't need to pay any of it. but they get irritable when someone points out that deficiency and they start babbling about how they could be sued if they charge someone a different fee than someone else is charged. but that fee puts them in charge and mandates the buyer's having to work down from that rather than the dealer having work up to gleen that extra profit.    here in ohio, the dealers are even trying to block tesla from using storefronts to sell rather than dealership buildings. can't have cars being sold through stores like walmart or cvs, can we. tesla has 3 stores iirc. i can just see all the lobby money going to the legislators. my state representative will not respond to questions about the document fee and the tesla sales model and the dealer lobbying. almost like the irs.    no wonder the stores can sell at invoice or below and build the new shiny showrooms they have and all the highly paid suits walking around while sales bots work their butts off. the gm stores have been improving their stores for 5 years or more, replacing or remodeling to get to white tile on the floor and a clean appearance. "
"June 22, 2014 12:19PM",stickguy,"   well, look at it the other way,  no other industry even publishes the dribble.  so take what you can get!  but since it is common knowledge that the published #s are more of a ""show me"" trick, just shop for the lowest actual price (which is the bottom line that matters).  what the manufacturer is doing behind the scenes to support the dealer (keep the metal moving) is up to them.    supply/demand and competition is still the driving force behind pricing.    also, we always hear that new car sales is somewhat of a loss leader to get you into the dealership.  other stuff (used cars, parts, service, f&amp;i) is where the real money is made, and you need the new car sales to front for all that. "
"June 22, 2014  1:26PM",abacomike,"  ""even the so-called experts, hondaing to usa today, said they didn't know what invoice is/was, yet they continue to publish this dribble."" there is a difference between dealer invoice and factory invoice.  dealer invoice is what the dealer pays the manufacturer for a vehicle delivered to his place of business for sale.  factory invoice does not include holdback or credits for incentives and other trunk money available to the dealer.  so the invoice numbers shown on edmunds is really factory invoice. dealers sell cars to their employees and some customers who are favored at what is called ""triple net""!  that is final dealer invoice after all incentives, holdback, trunk money, etc. i believe that listing invoice is essential in order for consumers to have a place to develop negotiating strategies.  without that, where does one start?  do you take msrp and subtract 8%, 9%, 10%?  it would be a complete guessing game with no idea of what a car could be purchased for. with an invoice price and some knowledge from edmunds of incentives or what others are paying, you can develop a negotiating strategy.  otherwise you could go from dealer to dealer like in the old days and never have any idea what to negotiate from. something is better than nothing, right?"
"June 22, 2014  1:51PM",imidazol97,"   do i interpret correctly what you've said to be that dealer invoice is a higher number because it includes money that eventually may be paid back to the dealer, holdback, trunk money, dealer incentives?    the factory invoice number is a lower value where all the holdback and other incentives to be paid to dealer have been subtracted?    and the edmunds number is really the lower of these two?

"June 22, 2014  2:27PM",stever,"   my mil died a few months back and the estate is moving slowly. but there is a line of buyers for her '03 buick. the executor may have to go the sealed bid route to avoid making half the town mad (it's a small town).    i'm not even sure the dealer owner knows the cost of a particular car until the books get closed at the end of the month or quarter. but having ""invoice"" price at least gives you a starting place to begin negotiations - $1,000 off invoice makes more sense to me than saying you want $3,000 off msrp.    we're negotiating house buying right now and we're not head over heels in love with any house and there's no hurry moving, so we're in the driver's seat a little bit. but one seller is a bank with little interest in compromising and the other seller is our age and doesn't care if we buy his house or not. i think that means someone else is going to overpay, but i've overpaid before for the ""right"" house. over time, it's really not about the money. "
"June 22, 2014  2:40PM",ab348,   i thought banks didn't like having houses on their books and preferred to have cash? i would have thought they would be eager to compromise.

"June 22, 2014  2:48PM",stever,"   , you'd think so wouldn't you? but you're dealing with a ""bureaucracy"" not a motivated seller. they countered and we've had longer buyer's remorse than usual, so we're going to keep looking.    , exactly. we begged our landlady to sell for six months, and paid $5,000 over appraisal in '84 on a modest home in anchorage (great neighborhood though), and financed it at 13%. we were underwater for 7 seven out of the 15 years we lived there and we broke even when we moved. it was perfect for us at that time in in our life and we never lost a bit of sleep over owning it. "
"June 22, 2014  3:32PM",mako1a,   it's not the amount they paid that makes a buyer happy...it's knowing he got it for 1 dollar less than the last guy. 
"June 22, 2014  3:54PM",graphicguy,"   here in ohio, the dealers are even trying to block tesla from using storefronts to sell rather than dealership buildings. can't have cars being sold through stores like walmart or cvs, can we. tesla has 3 stores iirc. i can just see all the lobby money going to the legislators. my state representative will not respond to questions about the document fee and the tesla sales model and the dealer lobbying. almost like the irs.  no wonder the stores can sell at invoice or below and build the new shiny  they have and all the highly paid suits walking around while sales bots work their butts off. the gm stores have been improving their stores for 5 years or more, replacing or remodeling to get to white tile on the floor and a clean appearance.    imid....well put.  i don't force any dealer to sell to me without a doc fee, as the last few cars i've purchased have been cash transactions.  of course, they eventually drop the fees when i don't include them in my offers, but not before some level of histrionics posed by the dealers.    most dealers will go below invoice with little prodding.  that tells us all we need to know about ""unknown trunk money"" being prevalent in most new car transactions.

"June 22, 2014  5:43PM",isellhondas,"   why should car dealers be ""transparent""?    why should car buyers know exactly what a dealer paid for a car?    if you buy a new camera, jewelry or construction material, you don't know this nor should you.    when i buy something i don't care what the store paid for it.  i only care if that item represents what i think is value for my dollars spent.    car dealers are fed up with invoice buyers and it sounds like the manufactures are finding ways to build some back door profit into the cars they are building.    good for them!  a merchant has to make a profit in order to pay overhead and stay in business.

"June 22, 2014  5:59PM",sterlingdog,"   you watched the open and you didn't see me?  we had tickets for one day so we drove over.  we saw the first hole in person, watched the remainder on the clubhouse tv with food and drink, and then went outside the back door to watch the 18th hole in person.  it's the lazy man's way, but my wife and i can't take that heat and humidity now that we are older.  believe me, you don't want to live there during an open.  we lived in pinehurst during the last open and it was the nightmare from hell.  no way we could eat in a restsaturnnt or get into a grocery store for two weeks.  they even closed the road to our housing development and routed us out the rear entrance which meant driving five miles out of the way to get back where you intended to go. some people rent their homes to news crews for $10,000 a week and go on vacation until the open has ended.  there is a downside to that you often come home to a trashed house and have to file an insurance claim for damage repairs.  those news guys will throw a party or two.  we got a couple of offers because our house was one mile from the airport.  we had formed a pact with our neighbors----no takers in our neighborhood.    prime contenders at this point?  ford ford crew cab xlt, chevrolet 1500 silverado, honda honda, jeep grand cherokee, and caddy cts.   wife has relented on the pick up truck which thrills me to no end.  i've wanted a truck for years.  color choices for the trucks are ruby red metallic or oxford white.  interior colors---cocoa tan or alabaster gray.  it's fun looking right now.  will keep you posted.    richard "

"June 22, 2014  7:35PM",isellhondas,"   well stated.    i used to love it when a used car buyer would get so frustrated when they knew they had no idea what we had paid for the car they were looking at.    some people just couldn't bear the thought that we might be making more profit then they thought was ""fair"".  fair to some people meant a 200.00 profit on a 20,000 car.

"June 22, 2014 10:33PM",Mr_Shiftright,"   but....you don't bargain for your refrigerator. the dealers set up their showrooms like a turkish rug market, so they can't have it both ways here.    if new cars had a bar code that the dealer scanned as you cashed out, then they wouldn't get so aggravated.

"June 22, 2014 11:06PM",oldfarmer50,   that all aluminum body would come in handy in my area but i understand the fdodgee is still steel. i heard it's 700 pounds lighter which would be astounding.    is the 5.0l the same coyote engine they put in the ford gt?  that would make for one screaming truck.

"June 22, 2014 11:26PM",stickguy,"   richard, i have an irrational impulse to get a pu again.  i actually had one many years ago (early 90s).  when we bought our first single family house, i splurged on a 1991 nissan extended cab pu.  rwd, 4 cyl, 5 speed stick.  burgandy.  i really liked that truck.  even after i hit a deer with it!  came in very handy.  bought a used dr set (saved a bundle) along with a bunch of other stuff.    sadly, only had it for about a year, because my son came along, and you could not put a car seat in the sideways facing jump seats.    for you, the new chevrolet/gmc looks like a really nice unit.  but that vs. the ford is certainly a matter of personal taste.  too big for me though.

"June 23, 2014  2:29AM",abacomike,"  ""while i have never been in phoenix i have been in arizona and nevada in august with triple digit heat with the top down."" from 1991-1998, i lived in palm desert, ca (one of the 10 cities in the coachella valley which includes palm springs).  from april through october, temps averaged between 98-115 degrees almost daily with some relief during spring and late fall - but rarely.  humidity levels were 30-35% in the mornings (when volkswagen courses were sprinkled) but dropped into the 15-20% level in afternoon and early evenings. the only time you could drive a convertible during that part of the year was in the late evenings when temps dropped into the. 90's. i used to frequent las vegas which was a 4 hour drive from palm desert and the heat there was just as bad.  where i lived was called ""low desert"" and vegas is considered ""high desert"" (3200 ft elevation).  my grandson was born in phoenix and i traveled there frequently.  phoenix is more humid than palm desert and las vegas because of the monsoonal air glow from the baja peninsula - air flow is from the southwest that time of year (late summer) and thunderstorms are fairly frequent as the temps rise in phoenix in the afternoon. but winters out there in the desert southwest are extremely dry (5% relative humidity is not uncommon).  i had to have a humidifier running every night to prevent nose bleeds.  but driving a convertible from november through april in the southwest is heavenly! the best time of the year out there"
"June 23, 2014  2:29AM",snakeweasel,   then why cant they be sued for charging a different price on a car? or is that putting to much logic into the argument.    can't be consumer friendly can we?

"June 23, 2014  1:10PM",bwia,"   i posted this on the buick buick forum but i thought i'd share it on this thread as well.    •   the buick appears small in pictures but the interior is very comfortable for four adults. at 6 feet tall and 248 pounds, i have no problem fitting in the driver's and front passenger's seat. i thought i would be compromised in the back seat but there is plenty of head, leg and knee room.    •   the sunroof is small and feels like a hole in the roof. a panododgeic moon roof would be more desirable.    •   i drove the buick under different road conditions. on the highway, it was silky smooth and quiet, maintaining speeds of 65 mph without the buzzing i would have expected in a 4-cylinder engine. in city driving the buick actually felt very quick because of its low end torque orientation. at times it felt like a spritely sports sedan rather than a suv.    •   on roads with portholes and imperfections you could feel the jolts and hear the thumps. compared to my buick it felt harsh and unrefined. blame that on its short wheel base of 100 inches and 18-inch tires    •   front visibility is quite good but not so for rear visibility. this weakness is mitigated somewhat by the back-up camera. but without directional and distance grid lines the camera is not as not as effective as it should. a major demerit for gm.    •   we had a major concern whether the tiny 1.3 liter 138 hp engine could climb steep hills without petering out but the buick handled those hills (with the ac on full blast to boot) with aplomb.    •   two areas of concern--the steering felt soft and the breaks a little mushy. i did not like the feel of either. they were just too soft for me but my wife thinks they are just right. since she is the primary driver i have no quarrel with her assessment.    •   the gas mileage is very good. after a week's worth of driving (not sure how many miles) the tank is still 1/3 full.    •   the technology on this baby buick is amazing---back-up camera, blind side detection, front and rear parking sensors and intellilink. the intellilink looks a little intimidating but all major functions can be activated by voice control. in terms of the weather and traffic navigation, we were not sure whether the signal came from sirius/xm or from gm's intellilink. (does anybody know?)    •   one final comment. while the buick is pricey, its interior refinement is very upscale (especially the saddle leather) and it addresses very well the interests of one of its target demographic, the empty nester.

"June 23, 2014  1:52PM",graphicguy,"   richard....i've always liked ford.  last pickup i bought was a good long while ago, and was a toyota tacoma.  drove in a friend's ford at the time, and immidieately knew i should have bought the ford instead.    there's a reason that it's been one of the top selling vehicles, across the board, for such a very long time.  ford puts a lot of engineering and thought into the ford, and it shows.  the fact that you can get a nice one for $8k off....pretty compelling!

"June 23, 2014  1:54PM",stever,"   , apparently the rh in places like phoenix has gone up over the last several decades due to all the grass getting watered in the 'burbs and on those volkswagen courses. my nose still takes a week to acclimate out there. boise was pretty ideal for a convertible, only had a few weeks out of the year where the temps would hang around 105°f.    got home to the up yesterday afternoon; first dry day in a week the neighbors said. got the grass mowed and even after that exercise, i had to go in and turn on the furnace since the house was 63°. drizzle and fog right now.    so, miata's have strong acs, right?    , re the backup camera, my newer used van has lots more bells and whistles than our old one, but i'd love to at least have rear parking sensors. that feature saved me in a rental buick in chicago one year when i almost backed into a pole.

"June 23, 2014  6:37PM",ab348,"   was at the dealer this morning for routine service on the buick turbo. no issues discovered although they tried to convince me to spend $92 for them to install a new air filter. no thanks, the neighborhood parts store has them for $17. i waited in the showroom for the car and looked around of course. they had a black silverado ""foose"" edition which i can't say i liked - a big black cow-catcher hoop on the front (bumper protector? ), big wheels that weren't too bad i guess, and a coal-mine black interior with perforated leather seats. the thing is huge of course. didn't see a price sticker on it.    also a new cts there, black/black also, 2.0 turbo, awd, no sunroof. i sat in it and liked it although the black interior was pretty dingy and i would never buy it in that color. don't know if i'd order one of these with that engine either. they also had a black (what is it with this outfit and black vehicles?) chevrolet ltz there, 20"" wheels, v6, and nice saddle leather seats although it was mostly black inside otherwise. big car though, maybe too big for me. also a chevrolet v6 convertible, red with black interior again, can't see black interiors in a convertible though, too hot in the sun. to complete the black equation they had a black chevrolet ltz 4-door with black interior as well, nothing special. oh, and a red chevrolet with a black interior. they apparently order most in-stock vehicles with black interiors because they think they are easier to sell. i dunno about that.    while i was sitting there an older gent came in driving a buick lucerne, not sure of the year, and started to deal on a new verano, the old fellow had done lots of online research, knew exactly what he wanted, and made them work to find the car in the color he wanted - mocha bronze with cashmere leather, no black interior for him! they went back and forth a few tines but in short order they shook hands on the deal. they are doing ""employee pricing"" here right now and that seemed to be the clincher for him. i was surprised by how quick it all went.    yesterday i gave the buick a hand wash and detail, so i thought i'd post a pic of it from when i got home from the dealer. this was midday so the sun was directly overhead, sorry about the harshness.

"June 23, 2014  6:41PM",graphicguy,"     great analogy, shifty!    point made, although they do get into the ""extended warranty"" game on tvs and appliances.    but, you're right about dealerships today.  they seem to like playing a little ""hide and seek"" on whatever the final price is going to be on the car.  doc fees, tire warranty, maintenance plans, lug nut locks, etc, etc, etc.    every time i hear ""i have to charge the doc fee.  it's a law.""  for years i've been asking them to show me the law they're referencing.  have yet to have one find it for me.    what you agree to at the sales person's desk ordinarily doesn't even remotely resemble what you are actually paying for the car once you get through all the ""add ons"", f&amp;i, doc feel, etc.  which again, is why i make one offer only, and it's all inclusive.  i know exactly what i'm paying before i leave the sales person's desk....including tax, down to the penny.

"June 23, 2014 10:55PM",abacomike," richard - welcome me to your club!!!  on saturday, my internet access went down.  i originally thought it was an area problem but, alas, it was probably my line or my modem/router.  i called comcast and sunday morning, their technician arrived.  he said it was my modem that crashed. he replaced my modem (which has a router included for wifi), and i again had internet access at noon yesterday.  but that was just the beginning of my trials and tribulations.  you see, because the modem/router is in the back bedroom (dad's room), the wifi signal is very weak by the time it gets to the front bedroom.  2 years ago i bought a ""repeater"" and set it up in the living room.  it picks up the signal from the back bedroom, amplifies it, and sends out the signal to the front bedroom, where i use my iphone for accessing the internet. unfortunately, when he changed the modem/router, the repeater was not able to convert the signal since it is on a different frequency.  so i read the directions first.  after reading them 4 times and fiddling with passwords and codes and wires, etc., i went to my dad and asked him for his .38 dodge pistol so i could put myself out of my misery. next, after choosing life over death this time, i called amped wireless to get some technical assistance.  after waiting for 55 minutes on the phone for a technician, i was overjoyed when a young man answered in a strange and husky accent - probably from the southern asian peninsula adjacent to the indian ocean.  i could not understand one out of every two words he spoke.  after 1 hour on the phone and getting absolutely nowhere,  i hung up.  i had wires, disks, power lines and papers filled with my notes all around me in a 6 foot circumference around the computer desk. i had second thoughts about my decision to live rather than commit suicide when, as if ""manna"" from heaven, i saw a business card drop to the floor from all my cache of notes and directions.  it was this geek who put my computer together three years ago - there is a god, no doubt about it. i called him, left a message, and he called me back and said he would be over at 400 pm today to fix the progdodgeming of the new router.  he got here at 410 pm, asked for a cold drink, sat down at the computer, and 4 minutes later, he asked me for a password for the router.  one minute later, and $40.00 poorer, he left and my repeater was working perfectly. richard, why couldn't i do that?"

"June 24, 2014  3:13PM",Mr_Shiftright,"     what i meant was that the $40 seems like a lot for 5 minutes, but his knowledge allowed him to do the job in 5 minutes. i think i misinterpreted your reaction. i thought that you thought that $40 was a lot of money for 5 minutes work, so i was defending the fee because it solved the problem.    you see this dilemma quite a bit in auto repair, where the experienced mechanic ""beats"" the flat rate by a considerable margin and still charges you the flat rate.    some folks think this unfair but again, if it took him 20 years to learn enough to beat the flat rate, more power to him.    of course, this presumes that he's actually doing the job he is supposed to. if he can do a 10 hour clutch job in 5, with his know-how and fancy tools, then fine. but if he fixes a leaking hydraulic line and calls it a ""clutch job"", that of course is dishonest.  <pre><code> no, i paid him for what he did! if i paid him for what he knew, that knowledge is worthless unless the knowledge was used by him to ""do"" the deed! the possession of knowledge is not worth the $40.00. it's the physical labor (5 minutes worth) on his part that earned him the money.</code></pre>"
"June 24, 2014  3:30PM",robr2,"   there are thousands of variations to the story but this sums it up    there was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things mechanical. after serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired. several years later his company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. they had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. in desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past. the engineer reluctantly took the challenge. he spent a day studying the huge machine. at the end of the day he marked a small ""x"" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated, ""this is where your problem is."" the part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. the company received a bill for $10,000 from the engineer for his service. they demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. the engineer responded briefly one chalk mark......................$1 knowing where to put it........$9,999 it was paid in full and the engineer retired in peace "

"June 24, 2014  5:55PM",bwia,"   she has an 811 fico score and only $1,100 in consumer debt. one lender told her that with her impeccable credit history she would qualify for a mortgage with only 5% down. she could put more money down if she tapped into her 401(k) but is reluctant to do so at this time.    the big hang-up with financing is the percentage of owner occupied units in the condo development/s. if it is below a certain percentage lenders won't budge. in some sectors of the housing market prices have rebounded appreciably but in others where owners are upside down they simply choose to walk away thus creating a vicious circle.    mike, based on your suggestion she will try to see if the lender will entertain the idea of a cosigner. my wife and i are both willing to cosign for her and return take her off our will.

"June 24, 2014  6:29PM",robr2,   give it a shot but i wouldn't expect that to work.  the building doesn't meet the standards needed for fannie mae or freddie mac so your co-signing won't change that.  unless of course the bank is planning to keep the loan for it's portfolio but that's rare nowadays.

"June 24, 2014  7:55PM",cdnpinhead,"   i'd throw in with the notion that the upfront money (down payment) would need to be greater when the development/developer is ""questionable.""    if she's planning to be there awhile and the building(s) are sound and in a good location, she can probably ride it out but needs to be prepared to put more down.

"June 25, 2014  4:16PM",imidazol97,"     i started looking through the standard and optional features for power folding mirrors. as i read ford's page, the xlt has as standard power folding mirrors, so they were on the truck you were driving.      an acquaintance through classic car interests just showed up with a 150 ford pickup. nice. big. and it's a 2-door iirc.    as for the garage, have you tried backing in? i find that's easier to do while watching the mirrors on my car,  and then pulling out is straight forward. "
"June 25, 2014  6:22PM",houdini1,"   one more suggestion.  i know you want an american made vehicle, but you should at least drive a 4 door toyota tacoma. i believe they are actually made in san antonio, tx.    for me, they are just the right size. no garage mods needed, plus it is very comfortable, costs less, gets better gas mileage, and will hold its value like mad.  if you love the tacoma, just pay for the ford repair to clear your conscience.

"
"June 25, 2014  8:01PM",henryn,"   on the suggestion for the tacoma -- if you're tall and / or wide, forget about the tacoma, you won't fit (smile).    a short while back qbrozen was trying to figure out the current rebates / incentives for a chrysler chrysler.  as i recall, none of the online resources were clear enough / accurate enough, and he finally had to go to the dealer to get the straight scoop.  i have just spent the past hour trying to figure out the current status of incentives for a grand caravan, to no avail.    i guess i too will have to trek to the dealer.   i would really rather have that information in hand before i show up, but oh, well. "

"June 25, 2014  8:42PM",stickguy,"   i was looking at the ford and it says power mirrors, but nothing specified about power folding. "
"June 25, 2014  8:49PM",houdini1,"   yes, if you are 6' 8"" and/or weigh 400 pounds, you might have a problem. otherwise you are good to go. "
"June 25, 2014  9:05PM",henryn,"   we're going to have to agree to disagree.  i am 6'2"" and weigh 300 lbs.  there isn't nearly enough headroom for me, and i definitely felt cdodgeped (side clearance). "
"June 25, 2014  9:11PM",henryn,"   that web page shows ""up to $2,500"", and if memory serves, qbrozen wound up with $6k or $7k in incentives.  so that web page is definitely not the full story. "
"June 25, 2014  9:27PM",houdini1,"   we have had the discussion before about height and head room. i am 6-1, weigh 160 lbs.and i have at least a foot of clearance between my head and the roof....but my height is in my legs. i have long legs and a short torso. you probably have a longer torso, and at 300 pounds you probably feel side cdodgeped in most vehicles. we disagree because we are both right. you feel cdodgeped in a tacoma and i don't !! "
"June 25, 2014  9:30PM",imidazol97,"   you are right.  i read that as power for folding. i assumed all mirrors are power controlled these days. but you are right.    i dug through more of the ford brochure and you have to get a lariat or fx2/fx4 model or some options higher than the xlt i was looking at to get power-folding mirrors.    but looking at the specs at the end of the pdf brochure, lower line models with mirrors are 97 in and with mirrors folded are 83.5 in a savings of 13.5 inches. big difference.   "
"June 25, 2014  9:41PM",jayrider,   the chevrolet silverado had the lowest step in and drove the most car like when i crossed shop them with ford and dodge in 1996. i seem to have read that those characteristics still seem to be present. once i drove the chevrolet -- the decision was easy. 
"June 25, 2014  9:45PM",houdini1,"   imid, good catch on the folding mirrors. my bet is that particular truck did have folding mirrors. since the damage was to one of the mirrors (like the truck, the mirrors are huge) if those things had been folded, richard probably would not have had a problem. "
"June 25, 2014 10:09PM",explorerx4,   imid beat me to it. power folding side mirrors are available on lariat and up models. 
"June 25, 2014 11:30PM",abacomike," another sales story as i posted last week, i helped my downstairs neighbor buy a new toyota for a great price.  i also mentioned that a unit owner on the other side of the building (one of my dad's old volkswagening buddies) asked my dad if he could ask me to help him buy a new sonata. i met with him this morning and went over the model, options, etc.  he decided to go with a 2015 se and it msrp'd at $23,315 and had an invoice of $22,231 hondaing to edmunds.  we noticed that there is a $500 loyalty incentive on the car and an additional $500 through their own financial institution if financed through them. we went over to the local dealer here and he did not have much inventory on the 2015's, but gave us a price of $22,500 less $500 loyalty less the financing incentive of $500 ending up with a price of $21,500 +tax/tag/fees.  hondaing to edmunds, that was an excellent offer.  the color he wanted was a light blue with gray cloth interior.  the sales manager did a locate and he had one coming in from the port next week - exactly the way he wanted it. he decided to buy the car (2.9% apr and a loan of $10,000).  he said he would pay it off after 6 months with no penalties. he signed all the paperwork, gave the salesman the vin on his 2009 sonata with registration (giving the 2009 to his son after he gets the new one) so he could qualify for loyalty bonus. the reason i brought this up was because this was the first experience i had ever had where the manager gave a price on the car that was at and even a little less than we wanted to pay without negotiating.  it was the easiest purchase i had ever experienced.  of course i had handed him one of my old business cards so he knew that i knew how to buy a car.  besides, this is a 2015, not a 2014. why can't all purchases be this easy.  hal was extremely elated that he is getting exactly what he wanted and will pick up his new car next week.  since they had a vin number on the incoming unit and was physically at the port. nice experience."

"June 26, 2014 12:50AM",abacomike,"  ""i'm always worried until taking possession on the actual car."" on the buyer's order, i had the manager sign this statement, which i have used many times to calm the anxieties of buyers ""...upon delivery if the 2015 hyundai sonata, vin #...., to the buyer on or before july 7, 2014, if the above referenced vehicle is delivered in a condition that is not satisfactory solely at the buyer's discretion, the earnest money in the amount of $2500 shall be refunded to said buyer and the above agreement shall be null and void.

"June 26, 2014 12:08PM",ab348,"   in either 1983 or 1984 i saw a newspaper ad from one of the local chrysler dealers with a screaming deal on a new lebaron 2-door - the little k-car based one. one evening i went to see the car. they showed it to me and it didn't look bad - sort of a creamy yellow outside, half-vinyl roof, gold or tan interior, wire wheel covers, rather nice-looking. i took it for a drive and it was ok, nothing special - these were essentially k-cars with a bit more sound insulation and nicer trim, so it was a rather underwhelming drive, but nice enough given the pricing. i stopped in a shopping center parking lot under one of their light standards to look it over on the outside (it was dark by the time i drove it). without a whole lot of effort i was able to see that the passenger side had been repainted - there was a tiny but of overspray in a few spots and it was missing the pinstripe that the other side had. clearly the car had sustained damage.    it annoyed me that they hadn't mentioned this so i returned to the dealer and raised it with the salesman. he pleaded ignorance but could not explain the damage or tell me the extent. with that i lost all interest and left. seems to me they would have been better off up-front coming clean about it rather than have a prospective buyer like me think that it could have had serious damage under the skin. "
"June 26, 2014 12:17PM",stever,"   the upper limit on disclosure is relatively high in some states - ohio, iirc, topped out at $6,000. under that and the dealer had no obligation per state law to inform the buyer that repairs had been done. some states may have no limit. i don't know how they could hide behind the law if you directly ask them about any repairs.    i'm not sure that $6,000 covers much these days although i recently saw a body shop advertising $699 paint jobs.    so, what can i do to sell you a brand new car today? let me take it to my mechanic for a ppi.

"June 26, 2014  7:06PM",sterlingdog,"   wrong answer.  i went in the garage with the mirrors wide open.  i folded the mirrors inward before backing out, but scraped that right side mirror.  my wife ,who was watching, thinks that i turned the steering wheel slightly as i was backing out which caused the mishap.  as for the folding mirrors, i did them by hand.  a friend told me that if you hold the power mirror button down for a few extra seconds, the mirror will actually fold in on its own.  i would have to try that.  even if the mirrors weren't a problem, it's still a tight fit.  i can barely get out on the driver's side because i have to move over so far to miss that brick pillar when i'm pulling in to the garage.  we'll see what the contractor says in the morning.    richard "
"June 26, 2014  7:14PM",sterlingdog,"   no, the driveway is too short and exits onto a side street because our house sits on a corner lot.  if it wasn't for that brick pillar in the center, i would have plenty of room in the garage.  if i can shave six inches off that pillar, i'll be in good shape.  i'm staying optimistic.    richard "

"June 27, 2014 11:00AM",bwia,"   that is actually a great idea but with a twist. instead of simply asking the neighbor for permission present them an offer to lease that small parcel of land for a reasonable fee. that way, you will have the legal and moral right to park your truck, without guilt or fear, should the neighbor decide to change his mind....i think its worth a shot. i gave that same advice to a friend once, and it worked.
