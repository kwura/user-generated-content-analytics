But are you a golden god, Tiny Dancer?</p><p> LD....got the reference!!!!!</p><p> I bought one and sold two in the last 3 weeks. One sold with a sign on it and the other one went to a craigslist responder an hour out of town. The used van we bought came from a dealer 20 minutes away after we did a three day road trip down to Wisconsin and test drove eight or so new cars down there, and tested another 4 or 5 vans within an hour of home.</p><p> I almost lost the local sale of my \\'97 Outback. The buyer saw the sign, drove the car and went home and raided his strongbox, all within an hour. Then I screwed up the title and had to wait until the next morning to talk to DMV (the joys of a small town, no line and the woman fixed it in 2 minutes). Meanwhile the buyer was having a little remorse and thought he heard a wheel bearing noise. So I knocked $100 off and since then I\\'ve seen him cruising around a lot. He claimed he was going to check it out and then give it to his daughter, but the way he had shined it up, I bet he keeps it for himself. It was a great winter ride.</p><p> The van \"sold\" sight unseen and while I was waiting for the buyer to drive the hour to my house to pick it up, I could have sold it to a local guy that was sort of a distant relation. That after it had been on craigslist a week and on the street with a sign on it for several days with zero interest. Go figure.</p><p> said: Anyone have an actual story about buying or selling a car?</p><p> Not yet.  But, I could retell my fabulous Jos A. Bank story!</p><p> If only I had cashed in my 401k/IRA prior to the Greenwich Concours...</p><p> Not a sales story, but a sales question(s)/observation.  It\\'s no secret that my two favorite brands of cars are Acura and BMW (not neccessarily in that order)..  BMW\\'s are fair in retaining their value, hurt by the fact that BMW coroporate offers sizeable subsidies on their value to make the leases more attrative.  Yet, they still sell for a premium on the used market.</p><p> Another one, Acura, is known as being the brand that has one of the best resale values among all brands, have been discounting their cars, as in the case with the new RLX, OVER $10K off MSRP.  So, the question here is, even though the previous RL was also heavily discounted, the resale value doesn\\'t \"appear\" to be affected.</p><p> Am I missing a piece of the puzzle here?</p><p> said: IIRC, the limit then was pretty small (1000 posts?). At least with 100K posts before we have to close it down it will take some time.</p><p> It was 500 posts, so that\\'s quite a few less than 100k.  It took us more than 8 years to get to 100k.</p><p> Well, I am the first person to post from London England. That Joseph El Banks story is going to get lost in  the archives. I may be the first person to post here using a Galaxy Tab10. All I can repo r t is there are lots of Mercedes here....about 15X as many as bmw!</p><p> said: We were discussing what is the real invoice number.

Just think, if this discussion goes on for years and years like the other did, visitors loading this discussion for the very first time will see YOUR name associated with the first member post. And I gave you a \"like.\" WOW!  I'm almost famous....... Thanks......  This is the all-new continuation of \"Stories from the Sales Frontlines.\"  The focus of that discussion has evolved over the years, so we're making the title more inclusive, asking members to post stories from the perspective of each side of the transaction. Wow, that's a throwback to the old, old, old board software (Well Engaged? I forget its name) where you had to do this all the time to keep a discussion going after a certain number of posts. The more things change...  Thanks for that. While this new board loads faster it just seems a little cumbersome and not very user friendly. Agreed. It is very dumb and complex at the same time. We don't even have a page number yet. Talk about NEW!  WOW!  I'm almost famous....... Thanks...... Well, you may be almost famous.  But are you a golden god, Tiny Dancer?  Wow, that's a throwback to the old, old, old board software (Well Engaged? I forget its name) where you had to do this all the time to keep a discussion going after a certain number of posts. The more things change... Having been through the archives just a few months ago, I saw all the discussions 'blah blah blah #6' and 'blah blah blah #7', where post #1 was a canned statement from the (then) host about this being a continuation. IIRC, the limit then was pretty small (1000 posts?). At least with 100K posts before we have to close it down it will take some time. If we average 25 posts a day, that's about 9000 a year - would take 11 years to get to 100K posts again. C'mon, people, I'm sure we can average more than 25 a day. Anyone have an actual story about buying or selling a car? Minnie Pearl \"I'm just so proud to be here\" !!  Probably not many will remember that one. At least I got on the first page. We were discussing what is the real invoice number. I believe the invoice numbers have been raised such as those shown in Edmunds to fool the purchaser. It's my feeling profit margin at least double that indicated by the reported invoice. I operated on that basis negotiating my Malibu purchase.  Well, you may be almost famous.  But are you a golden god, Tiny Dancer? LD....got the reference!!!!! I bought one and sold two in the last 3 weeks. One sold with a sign on it and the other one went to a craigslist responder an hour out of town. The used van we bought came from a dealer 20 minutes away after we did a three day road trip down to Wisconsin and test drove eight or so new cars down there, and tested another 4 or 5 vans within an hour of home. I almost lost the local sale of my '97 Outback. The buyer saw the sign, drove the car and went home and raided his strongbox, all within an hour. Then I screwed up the title and had to wait until the next morning to talk to DMV (the joys of a small town, no line and the woman fixed it in 2 minutes). Meanwhile the buyer was having a little remorse and thought he heard a wheel bearing noise. So I knocked $100 off and since then I've seen him cruising around a lot. He claimed he was going to check it out and then give it to his daughter, but the way he had shined it up, I bet he keeps it for himself. It was a great winter ride. The van \"sold\" sight unseen and while I was waiting for the buyer to drive the hour to my house to pick it up, I could have sold it to a local guy that was sort of a distant relation. That after it had been on craigslist a week and on the street with a sign on it for several days with zero interest. Go figure.  Anyone have an actual story about buying or selling a car? Not yet.  But, I could retell my fabulous Jos A. Bank story! If only I had cashed in my 401k/IRA prior to the Greenwich Concours... Not a sales story, but a sales question(s)/observation.  It's no secret that my two favorite brands of cars are Acura and BMW (not neccessarily in that order)..  BMW's are fair in retaining their value, hurt by the fact that BMW coroporate offers sizeable subsidies on their value to make the leases more attrative.  Yet, they still sell for a premium on the used market. Another one, Acura, is known as being the brand that has one of the best resale values among all brands, have been discounting their cars, as in the case with the new RLX, OVER $10K off MSRP.  So, the question here is, even though the previous RL was also heavily discounted, the resale value doesn't \"appear\" to be affected. Am I missing a piece of the puzzle here?  IIRC, the limit then was pretty small (1000 posts?). At least with 100K posts before we have to close it down it will take some time. It was 500 posts, so that's quite a few less than 100k.  It took us more than 8 years to get to 100k. Well, I am the first person to post from London England. That Joseph El Banks story is going to get lost in  the archives. I may be the first person to post here using a Galaxy Tab10. All I can repo r t is there are lots of Mercedes here....about 15X as many as bmw!  We were discussing what is the real invoice number. I believe the invoice numbers have been raised such as those shown in Edmunds to fool the purchaser. It's my feeling profit margin at least double that indicated by the reported invoice. I operated on that basis negotiating my Malibu purchase. I think it's been that way for a long time, though it may be getting worse.   For instance, BMWs don't have \"holdback\", but it's common knowledge that there is 5% of invoice of back-end money that BMW pays the dealer (which varies by CSI scores and volume).. And, some makes have such thin margins between MSRP and invoice, that there has to be more money on the back end (Volvo comes to mind). I received a letter addressed to the previous owners of our home. It's from a company wanting to reunited them with their unclaimed funds from somewhere in exchange for 20% of the unstated amount. Or they want to find their heirs for the same commission goal. I looked up the folks who used to live here and I find a mortgage company in Florida and a Sears amount in TX for more than $100 out of the states participating in the treasure hunt unclaimed funds page. None here in Ohio for the folks. Is it likely that's what the company is wanting to get 20% of? --something related to the mortgage? Either insurance refund or a settlement from the large mortgage company? I hope I can find the folks to forward this information that there may be missing money owed to them. speaking of missing money, recently someone that works with my wife said she saw out name on the NJ missing funds list.  Apparently there is a website where you can search by name to see what comes up.  She must have had some, so looked for other people she knew. And out name popped up. was obviously us, because the address was a bastardized mix of 1/2 our current, and 1/2 our last one.  and the date was in 1997, right around when we moved.  So, I filled out the couple of online question, and a few weeks later we got a legal looking form from the state.  Filled that out, and got it notarized, and sent it back.  And yup, in a few weeks, a check showed up. I never did figure out what it was from (obviously related to the house closing), but it would have been exceptionally easy for whoever had the money to find us, if they ever bothered to look. Instead, NJ used our money interest free for a decade! and I almost had a shopping story today.  Had to take my daughter over to the mall late in the afternoon to get a graduation dress (for her, not me!)  and we planned to stop at the Volvo dealer, Alas, it got too late, and the traffic at rush hour is nasty over that way, so we will have to do it some other time.  speaking of missing money, recently someone that works with my wife said she saw out name on the NJ missing funds list is a group of several states that share their information on unclaimed funds. Otherwise, check each state in which you lived or did business for unclaimed funds. The last 2 cars I sold myself, I wasn't actually actively selling. In 2003 my fleet consisted of a '78 Olds Delta 88 4-door, a '79 Buick Electra 225 Park Avenue, and my '68 Cutlass. Yes, in 2003. I'll leave the Cutlass out of this as it is a hobby car. For years when I lived and worked downtown, it was the only car I had. I walked most everywhere I needed to go. When I bought a house away from downtown in 1997, I needed a beater, and wanted a rear-drive car, preferably an Olds since I was familiar with the engine. The '78 Delta I found had a Rocket 350, was in reasonable shape, and was cheap - $2000. After I got it I found, of course, that it wasn't as good as I thought, and I went on a project for a few years upgrading it inside and out, though mechanically it was really pretty good. By the time 2002 came along, it was more than presentable and not bad at all for a car approaching 25 years of age. It was a good runner too, as these cars tended to be. In the fall of 2001 the Buick presented itself, a total creampuff owned by an elderly gent who had given up the little driving he did, and it was a steal. I had to buy it. So now I owned 2 boats. I had the old fellow store the Buick in his condo garage over the winter because I didn't want to drive it in the slop. In March, two things happened. He started bugging me to get it out of his garage, so I reluctantly parked it in my driveway and the Olds went to the curb outside my house. About a week later, we had a big ice storm. I remember hearing a big noise outside that Saturday morning, looked out the window, and saw a massive section of a maple tree that was next to the street, laying in the street, next to the Olds. I got dressed and went out to look at it. The fallen section was big enough that it was blocking the entire street. When it gave way, it raked the drivers side of the Olds pretty good, mashing the front fender, ripping off the door mirror, and doing some other assorted damage. It was a city tree, and after some wrangling with them, their insurance company agreed to go good for the repair. I found a similar car in a junkyard, got the necessary repair parts for short money, and came out about $1000 ahead on the insurance claim. So after it was repaired, it looked better than ever, with fresh paint on the drivers side of the car, but it wasn't getting much use since I was driving the Buick. One day a knock comes at my door and there is a guy there wanting to know if that was my Delta 88 and was I interested in selling it. He wanted it and I sold it for more than I paid originally. About a year later a similar thing happened. I was outside and a car pulls up. The guy gets out, wants to see the Buick and after looking it over asks if I wanted to sell it. I did, and flipped it to him for a grand more than I had paid. He then went and had it professionally repainted, did some other small cosmetic things (it needed very little) and drove it for a while. I still see it occasionally around town, though he has sold it subsequently. It was nice to not have to work to sell two old tuna boats! I am reading the online version and I'M confused by the title for an article in the Cincinnati Enquirer this morning Maybe I need another mug of coffee.\n"
